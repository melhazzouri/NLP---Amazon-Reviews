So they did a couple of updatesBetter camera ( not great )Crease still very visible , I mean come on , surly the design of the screen could have been improved. Aspect ratio just feels all wrongBattery life betterBut overall not worth the upgrade for what your paying ( your paying to flip a screen) nothing more

I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

I got mine from Verizon, but overall it's a great phone, I don't know why all the people who haven't touched one want to talk down on it.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

I like it, I was a really big fan of my S10 and replaced it with this. Sometimes having the big screen with a pen is really handy, and I like to play games and there's all sort of nifty stuff you can do with Xbox controllers, a pc and the phone combined if you're interested. Battery drains kinda fast if your on the big screen watching videos, etc. I don't have any issues with the bend in the middle. People that say ""I don't even see it!"" Are bs'ing you, you'll notice it. If the brightness is up its not a huge deal, but if your looking at something mono-colored or just very dark, it's pretty obvious. Still, having a phone that opens up into a tablet is pretty cool. I'm pretty tech-savvy and I still don't know how to get the most out of the whole dual left right screen thing. Also certain apps close/reset when you unfold. So if you're on ig watching some video and think ""I wanna see this bigger"" and unfold, it's gone and you'll probably never find where you were.

This device is not perfect, but after using it even a short while, I can never go back.  It would be great if there were more competition in this space.  I'd ask for less bulk, no divot in the middle (a sharp break or crease would be preferred), and maybe a built in pen like the galaxy note.

The over reviews made me wary of making a big purchase but my experience has been awesome in the last 2weeks. I bought a case, camera lens cover & stylus with the phone.Compared to my old iphone, the camera quality is great, the voice clarity is better and the battery life is more than adequate. I'm a medium user, but I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day and the charging is fast. Modern tech isn't rugged hence the case. If I had more cash to spend, i'd definitely buy this again! 5 stars

funcionaba muy bien, pero después de unos updates el teléfono empezó a laguearse, usar mucha memoria.lo compre prácticamente para jugar Runescape3 y ahora se laguea solo con moverte. La primera vez que veo que un teléfono caro no pueda mover ese juego, no lo recomiendo mejor compren un S22 ultra o la tablet s8 ultra seria mejor inversión y sin tanto slowdown.It worked very well, but after a few updates the phone started to lag, using a lot of memory.I bought it practically to play Runescape3 and now it lags just by moving. the first time I see that an expensive phone can not move that game, I do not recommend it, better buy an S22 ultra or the s8 ultra tablet, it would be a better investment and without so much slowdown.

The foldable phones are disposable. Don't just take my word for it, Google stress fractures and factory installed screen protectors falling off after a few months. Basically, your folding screen will fail in less than a year. Then your carrier says you need to contact Samsung who will offer to let you send the phone in for repair indefinitely or you can drive to a service center and spend all day while they fix it. They sell you a garbage product and they know it will fail so they intentionally give poor support hoping you will give up. Stay away!

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.

I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.

Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.

I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.

I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
58,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"

It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)

My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.

Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!

When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.

I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!

When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"

Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.

I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!

I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
69,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.

Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"

This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.

Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.

Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
74,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
75,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
76,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
77,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
78,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
79,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"

We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
81,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
82,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
83,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
84,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
85,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
86,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
87,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
88,"
Perfect for cameras
"
89,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
90,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
91,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
92,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
93,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
94,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
95,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
96,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
97,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
98,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
99,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
100,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
101,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
102,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
103,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
104,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
105,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
106,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
107,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
108,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
109,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
110,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
111,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
112,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
113,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
114,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
115,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
116,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
117,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
118,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
119,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
120,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
121,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
122,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
123,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
124,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
125,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
126,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
127,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
128,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
129,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
130,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
131,"
Great product!
"
132,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
133,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
134,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
135,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
136,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
137,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
138,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
139,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
140,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
141,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
142,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"

I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
144,"
Good
"
145,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"

I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"

Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"

Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
150,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
151,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
152,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
153,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
154,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
155,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
156,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
157,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
158,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
159,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.

"
167,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"

Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
172,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"

This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"

It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.

Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"

the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"

Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.

Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
185,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
186,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
187,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
188,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
189,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.

Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.

Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.

Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
205,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
206,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
207,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"

I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos

Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.

Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!

This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
213,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title

"
218,"
The best !!!!!
"
219,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
220,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
221,"
I love it
"
222,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.

Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
235,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
236,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
237,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
238,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy

"
244,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
245,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
246,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
247,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"

Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!
"
255,"
Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
256,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
257,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
258,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
259,"
Love it.
"
260,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.
"
267,"
Loved this tripod!!! It’s very sturdy
"

I use this every day! It's a perfect little tripod for vlogging cameras or phones.

I really love this tripod! The flexible legs are so awesome! Great value for the money!!
"

Best tripod ever,very sturdy and, comfortable grip.

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
277,"
Amazing product
"
278,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
279,"
Cute and sturdy
"
280,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
281,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
282,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
283,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
284,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
285,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
286,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
287,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
288,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"

I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

"
307,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.

"
319,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
320,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
321,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
322,"
Feels very durable!

Excellent quality from this tripod. Full recommended.

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
348,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
349,"
I really like it
"
350,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
351,"
Wow
"
352,"
Good
"
353,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
354,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
355,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
356,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
357,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
358,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
359,"
Stiff
"
360,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
368,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
369,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
370,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
371,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
372,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
373,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
374,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
375,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
376,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
377,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
378,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
383,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
384,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
385,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
386,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
387,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
388,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"

This is my second one. I used the hell out of the other one

A must have for vlogs!
"
398,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
399,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
400,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
401,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
402,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
403,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"

Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!

My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩
"

You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
408,"
It's worth recommending

It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
410,"
Es muy estable
"
411,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
412,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
413,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
414,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
415,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
416,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
417,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
418,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
419,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
420,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
421,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
422,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
423,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
424,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
425,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
426,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.

I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.

Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc

It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.

En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.

Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
433,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.

Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
437,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
438,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
439,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"

El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.

Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.

I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.

Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
446,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
447,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
525,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
526,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
527,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
528,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"

This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
547,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
548,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
549,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
550,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"

Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba

De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)
"
579,"
I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!
"
580,"
This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.
"
583,"
El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.
"
584,"
Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
585,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"
597,"
I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
598,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
599,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"

I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
601,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
602,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
603,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"

My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.

Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!

When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.

I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
609,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
610,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
611,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
612,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
613,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
614,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
615,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
616,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
617,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
618,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
619,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
620,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
621,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
622,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
623,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
624,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
625,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
626,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
627,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
628,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
629,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
630,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
631,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
632,"
Perfect for cameras
"
633,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
634,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
635,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
636,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
637,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
638,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
639,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
640,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
641,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
642,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
643,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
644,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
645,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
646,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
647,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
648,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
649,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
650,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
651,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
652,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
653,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
654,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
655,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
656,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
657,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
658,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
659,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
660,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
661,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
662,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
663,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
664,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
665,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
666,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
667,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
668,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
669,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
670,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
671,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
672,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
673,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
674,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
675,"
Great product!
"
676,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
677,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
678,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
679,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
680,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
681,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
682,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
683,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
684,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
685,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
686,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
687,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
688,"
Good
"
689,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
690,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
691,"
Versatility
"
692,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
693,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
694,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
695,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
696,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
697,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
698,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
699,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
700,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
701,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
702,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
703,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
704,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨

Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
711,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
712,"
Great product
"
713,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
714,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
715,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
716,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
717,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
718,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
719,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating

SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !

I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!

Just what I was looking for!

I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
725,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
726,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
727,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
728,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
729,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
730,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.

I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
732,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
733,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
734,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
735,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
736,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!

Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.

Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
739,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
740,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
741,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
742,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
743,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
744,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
745,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
746,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
747,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
748,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
749,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
750,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
751,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
752,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
753,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
754,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
755,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
756,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
757,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title

"
760,"
I love it and if needed i would shop again from this vendor
"
761,"
Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
762,"
The best !!!!!
"
763,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
764,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
765,"
I love it
"
766,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
767,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
768,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing

It is very sturdy and actually holds my camera which has an attached  lens

Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
779,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
780,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
781,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
782,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy

I love it soo much. I'm using it for my iPhone and my DSLR canon camera.
"
788,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
789,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
790,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
791,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"
792,"
Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
800,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
801,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
802,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
803,"
Love it.
"
804,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.
"
811,"
Loved this tripod!!! It’s very sturdy
"
812,"
I use this every day! It's a perfect little tripod for vlogging cameras or phones.
"

Best tripod ever,very sturdy and, comfortable grip.
"

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
821,"
Amazing product
"
822,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
823,"
Cute and sturdy
"
824,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
825,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
826,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
827,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
828,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
829,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
830,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
831,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
832,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"
833,"
I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

Love it
"
851,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.

"
862,"
Excellent
"
863,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
864,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
865,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
866,"
Feels very durable!

Excellent quality from this tripod. Full recommended.

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
892,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
893,"
I really like it
"
894,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
895,"
Wow
"
896,"
Good
"
897,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
898,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
899,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
900,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
901,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
902,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
903,"
Stiff
"
904,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
912,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
913,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
914,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
915,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
916,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
917,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
918,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
919,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
920,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
921,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
922,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
927,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
928,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
929,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
930,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
931,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
932,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"

This is my second one. I used the hell out of the other one

A must have for vlogs!
"
942,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
943,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
944,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
945,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
946,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
947,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"

Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!

It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
954,"
Es muy estable
"
955,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
956,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
957,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now

This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"

This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
961,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
962,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
963,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
964,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
965,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.

Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"

Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"

La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"

Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"

I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"

Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
972,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
973,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
974,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
975,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
976,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
977,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
978,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.

Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
981,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
982,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
983,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
984,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
985,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"

I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.

"

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
990,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"

I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

"

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
1069,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
1070,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
1071,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
1072,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
1073,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
1091,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
1092,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
1093,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
1094,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
1095,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba
"
1096,"
De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

To start this is the third or fourth Umidigi phones that I've.  The quality of the phone vs. the price is a good deal especially for a mid budget phone with performance that you'll not be disappointed.  Phone comes with pre-install screen protector, case, charging outlet, and USB C cable.The Good:* Stock Android 12 with no bloatware* Huge battery that can easily last two days of use (email checking, surf the web, and stream music)* Fast processor.  Didn't see any slow down or lag during use* Still come with 3.5mm audio jack* It's a 5G phone download speed is great when you are connected to a 5G network* It does have SD expansions slot or use as slot for two 5G sim cardPersonal dislike:* Camera quality is nothing to brag about but it's a mid budget phone which is expected* The fingerprint reader on the side work great but personally don't like the placementOverall aside from couple of personal dislike I'm very happy with the phone.  With the price you can a new phone ever 1 or 2 years instead paying premiums on a flagship phone that could cost easily 3 to 5 times of the price you pay for this phone.
"
1121,"
128GB / 8GB plus a SD RAM slot made this unit stand out. It also came with Android 12, a case and a pre installed screen protector. It has 3 cameras (main, macro and wide angle) on the back and a temperature sensor that can take body temps or give the temp of other objects. The 48GB main camera takes good pics. Call quality is good and the processor ran all my Android games without any issues. Battery life with the 5000 ma battery lasts me all day. Wireless charging isn't a function, but the box includes a nice 17W charger. The power button doubles as  finger print reader which is very handy. Facial recognition is also a function but most times the phone unlocks on my thumb print.Updated for battery life performance.  While being used the battery depletes like most other phones, but when not in use it seems to only use 5 to 8 % per day.

 I recently purchased an Umidigi A13 Pro 5G phone & I absolutely adore this phone- hence why the review.  To start things off it comes with a case and screen protector straight from the factory which is a bonus.  The phone is quick, bright and has a lot of storage.  My upgrade from the previous phone was quick and easy with Android OS 12.The camera quality is good and the fingerprint reader works great.  This is also my first 5g cell phone and the speeds are impressive.  Overall I've enjoyed using this phone for the last week and look forward to owning it for years to come.

 【見た目】背面はプラスチック製ですが、レザー調で購入感があります。重さは200g程度なので、軽く感じます。ガラス外面や金属筐体ではもっと重くなるかと思います。重さのわりに迫力のある大画面・高解像度でさらにはリフレッシュレートも高くぬるぬる動きます。女性にはちょうどいいのではないでしょうか。UMIDIGIはじめ最近のスマホではよく見る光景ですが、画面保護フィルム（ガラスではない）とTPUケースが標準装備で、すぐに持ち出すことが可能です。【スペック・動作】試しにツムツムをプレイしてみましたが、さすがDimensity 700を搭載してるだけあって、遅延などはなくスムーズにプレイできます。１万円台、２万円台のMTK系海外スマホではカクつきが起こることが多く、まともにプレイできませんが、本機であれば「多少ゲームをする」という方にも満足いくスペックかと思います。【その他】温度センサー（カメラで温度をみる）機能や、スマートキーで好きなアプリを起動できたりと、UMIDIGIらしさはそのままで、他社格安スマホにも引けを取らない良機種だと思います。付属ACでは1400mAh充電が可能でした。２時間もかからず満充電になるかと思います。

 Looking for a new phone replacing my 3 year old Umidigi F2 phone. Found this budget 8GB/128GB 5G phone on Amazon with less than $300 after applying $70 coupon which is much less than Costco Moto 5G phone with higher price and 4GB only memory.A13 Pro 5G has very similar physical dimensions comparing to F2 with a better contour design comes with Polycarbonate textured material at the back.Smart button activates touchless temperature sensor is very convenient applying for both person and object. I was able to customize the smart button for one press, two presses or long press. Very impressive.This phone has a great speed improvement when I play with Call on Duty modern warfare gaming. Found no lag when watching TUBI full movies for an hour with great sound and resolution.The extended battery life (5150mAh) provides good average usage for a whole day including gaming on my regular train ride time.Camera quality is above average on this budget phone and surprisingly well on a 5M macro lens shot. I can do a good close-up on fish eggs (roe) and a running shoe texture. Play around camera’s various settings such as ISO exposure, contrast level and beauty making photo shot much fun.A very impressive experience with this 5G value phone and highly recommended.

This is my 3rd Umidigi over the years. The first two have been excellent and I like the features on this phone. Camera is the best, storage, speed, can customize text and phone sound.I am sure it a fluke BUT I can only use phone on speaker mode. I am trying to live with it but I think I will return for another unit. No backup service staff to call. This is first phone bought from Amazon so this too is a disappointment. Update Nov 7 I finally returned and as usual Amazon was top notch with credit.
"
1127,"
This is the second Umidigi phone I have. Great value compared with the big brands. It has anything I need for my daily use. Speed is good. Fingerprint and face recognition work perfectly. Photos are sharp. The battery can support two days when no heavy use. NFC is a nice convenient feature this phone provides. In all, I love this device.

 【見た目】背面はプラスチック製ですが、レザー調で購入感があります。重さは200g程度なので、軽く感じます。ガラス外面や金属筐体ではもっと重くなるかと思います。重さのわりに迫力のある大画面・高解像度でさらにはリフレッシュレートも高くぬるぬる動きます。女性にはちょうどいいのではないでしょうか。UMIDIGIはじめ最近のスマホではよく見る光景ですが、画面保護フィルム（ガラスではない）とTPUケースが標準装備で、すぐに持ち出すことが可能です。【スペック・動作】試しにツムツムをプレイしてみましたが、さすがDimensity 700を搭載してるだけあって、遅延などはなくスムーズにプレイできます。１万円台、２万円台のMTK系海外スマホではカクつきが起こることが多く、まともにプレイできませんが、本機であれば「多少ゲームをする」という方にも満足いくスペックかと思います。【その他】温度センサー（カメラで温度をみる）機能や、スマートキーで好きなアプリを起動できたりと、UMIDIGIらしさはそのままで、他社格安スマホにも引けを取らない良機種だと思います。付属ACでは1400mAh充電が可能でした。２時間もかからず満充電になるかと思います。

 Looking for a new phone replacing my 3 year old Umidigi F2 phone. Found this budget 8GB/128GB 5G phone on Amazon with less than $300 after applying $70 coupon which is much less than Costco Moto 5G phone with higher price and 4GB only memory.A13 Pro 5G has very similar physical dimensions comparing to F2 with a better contour design comes with Polycarbonate textured material at the back.Smart button activates touchless temperature sensor is very convenient applying for both person and object. I was able to customize the smart button for one press, two presses or long press. Very impressive.This phone has a great speed improvement when I play with Call on Duty modern warfare gaming. Found no lag when watching TUBI full movies for an hour with great sound and resolution.The extended battery life (5150mAh) provides good average usage for a whole day including gaming on my regular train ride time.Camera quality is above average on this budget phone and surprisingly well on a 5M macro lens shot. I can do a good close-up on fish eggs (roe) and a running shoe texture. Play around camera’s various settings such as ISO exposure, contrast level and beauty making photo shot much fun.A very impressive experience with this 5G value phone and highly recommended.

you never believe that you can buy a cell phone with about 85--90% as good as a Iphone  at such good price

This is my 3rd Umidigi over the years. The first two have been excellent and I like the features on this phone. Camera is the best, storage, speed, can customize text and phone sound.I am sure it a fluke BUT I can only use phone on speaker mode. I am trying to live with it but I think I will return for another unit. No backup service staff to call. This is first phone bought from Amazon so this too is a disappointment. Update Nov 7 I finally returned and as usual Amazon was top notch with credit.

Really good phone for the money..love the camera... great size to watch movies and play videos.  Easy to navigate, fast and come with a clear case and protective glass already!!

This is the second Umidigi phone I have. Great value compared with the big brands. It has anything I need for my daily use. Speed is good. Fingerprint and face recognition work perfectly. Photos are sharp. The battery can support two days when no heavy use. NFC is a nice convenient feature this phone provides. In all, I love this device.

To start this is the third or fourth Umidigi phones that I've.  The quality of the phone vs. the price is a good deal especially for a mid budget phone with performance that you'll not be disappointed.  Phone comes with pre-install screen protector, case, charging outlet, and USB C cable.The Good:* Stock Android 12 with no bloatware* Huge battery that can easily last two days of use (email checking, surf the web, and stream music)* Fast processor.  Didn't see any slow down or lag during use* Still come with 3.5mm audio jack* It's a 5G phone download speed is great when you are connected to a 5G network* It does have SD expansions slot or use as slot for two 5G sim cardPersonal dislike:* Camera quality is nothing to brag about but it's a mid budget phone which is expected* The fingerprint reader on the side work great but personally don't like the placementOverall aside from couple of personal dislike I'm very happy with the phone.  With the price you can a new phone ever 1 or 2 years instead paying premiums on a flagship phone that could cost easily 3 to 5 times of the price you pay for this phone.

128GB / 8GB plus a SD RAM slot made this unit stand out. It also came with Android 12, a case and a pre installed screen protector. It has 3 cameras (main, macro and wide angle) on the back and a temperature sensor that can take body temps or give the temp of other objects. The 48GB main camera takes good pics. Call quality is good and the processor ran all my Android games without any issues. Battery life with the 5000 ma battery lasts me all day. Wireless charging isn't a function, but the box includes a nice 17W charger. The power button doubles as  finger print reader which is very handy. Facial recognition is also a function but most times the phone unlocks on my thumb print.Updated for battery life performance.  While being used the battery depletes like most other phones, but when not in use it seems to only use 5 to 8 % per day.

 I recently purchased an Umidigi A13 Pro 5G phone & I absolutely adore this phone- hence why the review.  To start things off it comes with a case and screen protector straight from the factory which is a bonus.  The phone is quick, bright and has a lot of storage.  My upgrade from the previous phone was quick and easy with Android OS 12.The camera quality is good and the fingerprint reader works great.  This is also my first 5g cell phone and the speeds are impressive.  Overall I've enjoyed using this phone for the last week and look forward to owning it for years to come.

This really is a good simple charger. And like most others this actually comes with the cord and the box to plug it in to charge. I have a 13 pro max. Now it won’t fit in with a case on it standing straight. But if you turn it sideways it will still charge. Without the case in it fits just fine. And it’s metal or some sort of metal. Definitely durable.

Move 2, 2022 update: wireless charger completely stopped working 8 days after initial use. Exchanging. Hopefully the next one will last a bit longer...Although I asked questions, I got no response from the seller, so I thought I'd purchase one of these and check it out.One question I asked was whether this charger supports Qi EPP (Extended Power Profile), which is the standard promulgated by the Wireless Power Consortium for fast (15W) wireless charging. This standard is primarily used by Google Pixel and Sony Xperia and LG phones. There is nothing on the equipment (stand or included adapter), box, or documentation that suggests it supports Qi EPP.I asked which Pixel phones this charger supports because the product description says it supports ""15W for some Pixel and LG phones."" There is nothing on the box to suggest that it supports Pixel or LG phones at all. However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.

After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.

I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.
"
1169,"
Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.
"
1170,"
The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.

I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.
"

This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.

This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.

This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

I received my Intoval Wireless Charing Stand Y3 last Friday from Amazon and I have to say this thing is amazing. It is very well constructed out of aluminum giving it a very premium feal to it. You can charge your phone either standing up or sideways. It also comes with a wall charger and a USB A (which plugs into the charger) to USB C (which plug into the stand. I have the Gun Grey one which matches really well with my MacBook Pro. This is a fast charging stand with an output rating of 5W/7.5W/10W/15W. I did not run into any issues charging my iPhone 13 Pro Max.The only thing of note is that the cord that comes with the unit is a little on the smaller side. If you need a longer cord, then you may want to order a longer USB A cable with this, as the one that comes with it, is only about 3 feet long. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry.

This wireless charging stand was exactly what I was looking for my desk at the office. It isn't the most stylish thing to look at, but it does it's job. It came with a wall charger piece to go with the charging cord, which was very convenient. I like that it charges the phone in either a vertical or horizontal position. It's wide enough so I can charge my Galaxy S22 phone with it's slim case on. I wish it came in a true black color as I'd like to purchase another.

This is a quality made aluminum phone charging stand. I got the silver one and it's the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro with an Otterbox cover. It's narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space and it charged my phone from 64% to 100% in an hour and :45 minutes. A nice feature is that it came ready to use - it included the charger cord and electric outlet plug, so no rooting around for an adapter to make it work. The phone actually sits a little higher on this charger, but I've found the weight of the phone seems to keep it stabilized. All said, a nice product.

First off, it charges about as fast as your basic charger. My husband has been using this at work for both his personal cell and his work cell. His personal phone has a protective Rhinoshield case while his work phone (pictured) has an Otterbox. It will charge his work phone through the case, but it doesn’t fit vertically unless you balance it like we have pictured. We ordered it specifically for his personal phone, and it fits inside perfectly fine. It charges in both orientations and through both cases.

Item arrived looking just like the picture.  I ordered it to put on my kitchen counter to meet a couple of needs.  I wanted something to hold the phone upright when cooking/following a recipe and I also wanted to be able to charge it because I always seem to find that I have low power when I need it for a while.  I unboxed it, plugged it in, and was good to go.  I holds and charges my iphone 12 pro without issue in both a vertical and horizontal position which was a bonus.  So far it has completely met my needs.

I really like this charger for many reasons.-It is a single formed piece of metal. There are no hinges to collapse or fail unexpectedly. No plastic to crack. Because of this design, it's not meant to be portable though.-The metal is very rigid but also very thin which gives it a sleek unobtrusive look.-I have the green color which has a nice shiny metallic finish.-The charging port is your generic USB-C which goes straight out the back allowing you to hide the cable.-The main negative is that the width is limited if you want to set your phone vertically. 85mm is what I measured as the maximum width. My Galaxy S20 with thin case fits with room to spare. You can also place the phone horizontally but it looks a bit awkward.

I have used this for two nights and it seems to charge well. It is sturdy. The cell phone does not fall off the stand and it has given me extra room on my bedside table. The color pink is gorgeous.

Works great! My phone is able to charge on this without taking protective case off. Like that you can set it upwards or sideways. Perfect size for my nightstand. Charges fast
"

This was super easy to install. It holds my phone either way, and even with the OtterBox case will charge it but if you do have a thicker case like an OtterBox, it won’t sit in there vertically you have to set it in there horizontally.  It does come with the AC block to plug-in which was great.

 This charging phone holder is made up of a metal that is of great quality. I am surprisingly happy with this. I’ll never buy any others if Something Happens with this I’ll buy another one. That’s how good of a quality that says and I’m not just saying that because I’m a vine reviewer, but because I’ve been using this for a week now and it has been awesome you can put your phone in it upright or you can put your phone sideways on it holds it both ways. It was is a great value durable and sturdy also.

I love this iPhone and Apple watch charger! Just drop your watch on the watch charger and it just connects! Same goes for the phone charger. No more missed connections for charging and the stand takes up less room on your table than all those cords! A great charging station.
"

So cute, great pink color, seems like it should be a great product, but this thing is so flippin' slow to charge, it's really inexcusable. My daughter put her phone (iphone 12 pro max which is listed as a ""compatible device"") on it at 11%. 8.5 hours later, it was at 83%. This is her consistent experience with this ""charger."" Just absolutely unacceptable that any charger can't charge your phone to 100% overnight. Frankly, I don't understand the positive reviews. In our experience, this thing is essentially just a phone stand. We can't recommend.
"
1196,"
The only thing I can find to complain about is the lack of a lip or edge, to keep the phone from sliding off the front. If I wasn't trying to tap buttons on it while it sits, or if I didn't have a bracket on the back, i don't think I'd have notices. The rubbery pads work well enough for that.Charges quickly.I love the two orientations.

So they did a couple of updatesBetter camera ( not great )Crease still very visible , I mean come on , surly the design of the screen could have been improved.

I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

I like it, I was a really big fan of my S10 and replaced it with this. Sometimes having the big screen with a pen is really handy, and I like to play games and there's all sort of nifty stuff you can do with Xbox controllers, a pc and the phone combined if you're interested. Battery drains kinda fast if your on the big screen watching videos, etc. I don't have any issues with the bend in the middle. People that say ""I don't even see it!"" Are bs'ing you, you'll notice it. If the brightness is up its not a huge deal, but if your looking at something mono-colored or just very dark, it's pretty obvious. Still, having a phone that opens up into a tablet is pretty cool. I'm pretty tech-savvy and I still don't know how to get the most out of the whole dual left right screen thing. Also certain apps close/reset when you unfold. So if you're on ig watching some video and think ""I wanna see this bigger"" and unfold, it's gone and you'll probably never find where you were.

This device is not perfect, but after using it even a short while, I can never go back.  It would be great if there were more competition in this space.  I'd ask for less bulk, no divot in the middle (a sharp break or crease would be preferred), and maybe a built in pen like the galaxy note.

The over reviews made me wary of making a big purchase but my experience has been awesome in the last 2weeks. I bought a case, camera lens cover & stylus with the phone.Compared to my old iphone, the camera quality is great, the voice clarity is better and the battery life is more than adequate. I'm a medium user, but I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day and the charging is fast. Modern tech isn't rugged hence the case. If I had more cash to spend, i'd definitely buy this again! 5 stars

The foldable phones are disposable. Don't just take my word for it, Google stress fractures and factory installed screen protectors falling off after a few months. Basically, your folding screen will fail in less than a year. Then your carrier says you need to contact Samsung who will offer to let you send the phone in for repair indefinitely or you can drive to a service center and spend all day while they fix it. They sell you a garbage product and they know it will fail so they intentionally give poor support hoping you will give up. Stay away!

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"

I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
1252,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
1253,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
1254,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
1255,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
1256,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"
1257,"
I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
1258,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
1259,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
1260,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.
"
1261,"
I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
1262,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
1263,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
1264,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
1265,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
1266,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
1267,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
1268,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
1269,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
1270,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
1271,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
1272,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
1273,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
1274,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
1275,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
1276,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
1277,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
1278,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
1279,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
1280,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
1281,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
1282,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
1283,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
1284,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
1285,"
Perfect for cameras
"
1286,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
1287,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
1288,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
1289,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
1290,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
1291,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
1292,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
1293,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
1294,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
1295,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
1296,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
1297,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
1298,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
1299,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
1300,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
1301,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
1302,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
1303,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
1304,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
1305,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
1306,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
1307,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
1308,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
1309,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
1310,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
1311,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
1312,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
1313,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
1314,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
1315,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
1316,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
1317,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
1318,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
1319,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
1320,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
1321,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
1322,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
1323,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
1324,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
1325,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
1326,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
1327,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
1328,"
Great product!
"
1329,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
1330,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
1331,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
1332,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
1333,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
1334,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
1335,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
1336,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
1337,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
1338,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"

I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"

I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.

Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"

I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.

Versatility

Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!

Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
1347,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.

It's a decent tripod. nothing special

Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
1351,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
1352,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
1353,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
1354,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
1355,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
1356,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
1357,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨

 Leg broke at base , really sad because this thing is awesome
"
1361,"
Easy to use
"
1362,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
1363,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
1364,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
1365,"
Great product
"
1366,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
1367,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
1368,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
1369,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
1370,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
1371,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
1372,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
1373,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
1374,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
1375,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
1376,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
1377,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
1378,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
1379,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
1380,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
1381,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
1382,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
1383,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
1384,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
1385,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
1386,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
1387,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
1388,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
1389,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
1390,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
1391,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
1392,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
1393,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
1394,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
1395,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
1396,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
1397,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
1398,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
1399,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
1400,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
1401,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
1402,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
1403,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
1404,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
1405,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
1406,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
1407,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
1408,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
1409,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
1410,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title
"
1411,"
These hold up my phone and projector perfectly.
"
1412,"
functional and as described, would recommend.
"
1413,"
I love it and if needed i would shop again from this vendor
"
1414,"
Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
1415,"
The best !!!!!
"
1416,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
1417,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
1418,"
I love it
"
1419,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
1420,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
1421,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing
"
1422,"

It fits my LUMIX Fz300 perfectly! I’m loving this tripod. It also feels very safe for my camera.
"

I love this product! Flexible, Sturdy and can be used with DSLR and iPhone camera! Love love love
"
1425,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone
"
1426,"
Love this for our Gopro Hero 7! It is so much more sturdy than the other options in this style. Definitely recommend it!
"
1427,"
Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.
"
1428,"
Buen material y muy funcional...

It is very sturdy and actually holds my camera which has an attached  lens
"
1431,"
Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
1432,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
1433,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
1434,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
1435,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy
"
1436,"

"
1437,"
Perfect in any situation holds my dslr canon 60D and the clip holds bloggie touch and I phone. Great value
"

Exactly what I was looking for! Works perfect for my iPhone and my large DSLR. The legs are super moldable but sturdy. I love it!

"
1440,"
I love it soo much. I'm using it for my iPhone and my DSLR canon camera.
"
1441,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
1442,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
1443,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
1444,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"
1445,"
Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!
"

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
1453,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
1454,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
1455,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
1456,"
Love it.
"
1457,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.

Best tripod ever,very sturdy and, comfortable grip.

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
1474,"
Amazing product
"
1475,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
1476,"
Cute and sturdy
"
1477,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
1478,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
1479,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
1480,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
1481,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
1482,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
1483,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
1484,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
1485,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"
1486,"
I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

It has worked great on our recent trip. Good product.
"
1503,"
Love it
"
1504,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.
"
1506,"
It is very flexible & convenient!

"
1515,"
Excellent
"
1516,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
1517,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
1518,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
1519,"
Feels very durable!
"
1520,"
Excellent quality from this tripod. Full recommended.
"

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
1545,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
1546,"
I really like it
"
1547,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
1548,"
Wow
"
1549,"
Good
"
1550,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
1551,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
1552,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
1553,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
1554,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
1555,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
1556,"
Stiff
"
1557,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

"
1564,"
using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
1565,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
1566,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
1567,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
1568,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
1569,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
1570,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
1571,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.

I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
1573,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"

I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
1580,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
1581,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
1582,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
1583,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
1584,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.

Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.

It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
1596,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
1597,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
1598,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"

Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!

The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
1609,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
1610,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
1611,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
1612,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
1613,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
1614,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
1615,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
1616,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
1617,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
1618,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
1619,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
1620,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
1621,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
1622,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
1623,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
1624,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"

I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
1626,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
1627,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
1628,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
1629,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
1630,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
1631,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
1632,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
1633,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
1634,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
1635,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
1636,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
1637,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
1638,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
1643,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
1644,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
1722,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
1723,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
1724,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
1725,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
1726,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
1744,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
1745,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
1746,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
1747,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
1748,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba
"
1749,"
De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.
"
1773,"
I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.
"
1774,"
Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.
"
1775,"
We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)
"
1776,"
I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!
"
1777,"
This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
1782,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.
"
1784,"
Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)
"
1786,"
I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!
"
1787,"
This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"
1794,"
I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
1795,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
1796,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
1797,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
1798,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
1799,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
1800,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"
1801,"
I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
1802,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
1803,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
1804,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.
"
1805,"
I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
1806,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
1807,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
1808,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
1809,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
1810,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
1811,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
1812,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
1813,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
1814,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
1815,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
1816,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
1817,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
1818,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
1819,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
1820,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
1821,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
1822,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
1823,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
1824,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
1825,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
1826,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
1827,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
1828,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
1829,"
Perfect for cameras
"
1830,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
1831,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
1832,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
1833,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
1834,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
1835,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
1836,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
1837,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
1838,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
1839,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
1840,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
1841,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
1842,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
1843,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
1844,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
1845,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
1846,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
1847,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
1848,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
1849,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
1850,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
1851,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
1852,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
1853,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
1854,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
1855,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
1856,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
1857,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
1858,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
1859,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
1860,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
1861,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
1862,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
1863,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
1864,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
1865,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
1866,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
1867,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
1868,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"

The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.

Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
1871,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
1872,"
Great product!
"
1873,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
1874,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
1875,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
1876,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
1877,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
1878,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
1879,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
1880,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
1881,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
1882,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
1883,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
1884,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
1885,"
Good
"
1886,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
1887,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
1888,"
Versatility
"
1889,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
1890,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
1891,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
1892,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
1893,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
1894,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
1895,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
1896,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
1897,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
1898,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
1899,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
1900,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
1901,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨
"

Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

 Leg broke at base , really sad because this thing is awesome
"
1905,"
Easy to use
"
1906,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
1907,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
1908,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
1909,"
Great product
"
1910,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
1911,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
1912,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
1913,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
1914,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
1915,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
1916,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
1917,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
1918,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
1919,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
1920,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
1921,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
1922,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
1923,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
1924,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
1925,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
1926,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
1927,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
1928,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
1929,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
1930,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
1931,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
1932,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
1933,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
1934,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
1935,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
1936,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
1937,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
1938,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
1939,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
1940,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
1941,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
1942,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
1943,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
1944,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
1945,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
1946,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
1947,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
1948,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
1949,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
1950,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
1951,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
1952,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
1953,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
1954,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title
"
1955,"
These hold up my phone and projector perfectly.

Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
1959,"
The best !!!!!
"
1960,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
1961,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
1962,"
I love it
"
1963,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
1964,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
1965,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing

1969,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone

Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.

"
1976,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
1977,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
1978,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!

1979,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy

Perfect in any situation holds my dslr canon 60D and the clip holds bloggie touch and I phone. Great value

"
1984,"

"
1985,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
1986,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
1987,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
1988,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!

"
1997,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
1998,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"

I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
2022,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
2023,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
2024,"

"
2025,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
2026,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
2027,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
2028,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"

This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.

"
2060,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
2061,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
2062,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
2063,"

"

Exactly as described

Perfect
"

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
2089,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
2090,"
I really like it
"
2091,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
2092,"
Wow
"
2093,"
Good
"
2094,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
2095,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
2096,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
2097,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
2098,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
2099,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
2100,"
Stiff
"
2101,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

have used for only a few months and have two legs broken!!

This product I received was terribly damaged.

Great design, quality materials, and a great price and size!
"
2108,"
using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
2109,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
2110,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
2111,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
2112,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
2113,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
2114,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
2115,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
2116,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
2117,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
2118,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
2119,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

2121,"
Sturdy and comes with holder attachment for phone.
"
2122,"
Very handy and versatile tripod! Will order again as a gift because I want my family and friends to have this
"
2123,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
2124,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
2125,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
2126,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
2127,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
2128,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
2129,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"
2130,"
perfect tripod
"
2131,"
Love using this hold the camera for videos or to set up a tripod.
"
2132,"
Works on anything your trying to film from
"

Flexible, small and sturdy. Good for travel.

"

Works as advertised, lightweight great for the trails
"
2137,"
This is my second one. I used the hell out of the other one
"
2138,"
A must have for vlogs!
"
2139,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
2140,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
2141,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
2142,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
2143,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
2144,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"
2145,"
Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!
"
2146,"
My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩
"
2147,"
Perfect
"
2148,"
You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
2149,"
It's worth recommending
"
2150,"
It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
2151,"
Es muy estable
"
2152,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
2153,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
2154,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
2155,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
2156,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
2157,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
2158,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
2159,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
2160,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
2161,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
2162,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
2163,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
2164,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
2165,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
2166,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
2167,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
2168,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
2169,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
2170,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
2171,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
2172,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
2173,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
2174,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
2175,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
2176,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
2177,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
2178,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
2179,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
2180,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
2181,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
2182,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"
2183,"
I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.
"
2184,"
Me gustó, muy útil para varias posiciones y aguanta perfecto una réflex
"
2185,"
Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"
2186,"
I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
2187,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
2188,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.
"
2189,"
Excelente producto, me encantó y muy resistente.
"
2190,"
No aguanta mucho el peso de la cámara
"
2191,"
The tripod is super flexible and very sturdy for sure to be put in various position.
"
2192,"
Es un gran producto el mejor que he hecho hasta ahora, espero en un futuro comprar la version 2 de este tripie
"
2193,"
Love it, I 've had it for a while. love using it whenever I'm vlogging
"

Esta increíble, no pesa y lo puedes llevar a cualquier lado! Súper fácil de utilizar. Yo lo utilizo con mi cámara Eos sin problema de peso.

Easy to carry around.
"
2200,"
I like it a lot. Sturdy, stable and well made.
"
2201,"
Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!
"
2202,"
Perfect tripod for everyday use! Good for vlogging! BTW if you are a car enthusiast follow me on IG and Youtube @grimm_gen, I post car content!😁

"

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
2266,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
2267,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
2268,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
2269,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
2270,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"
2271,"
If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod
"
2272,"
Best combo of Gorilla pod and Pixi mini tripod. Superb for beginners

I am a foreign language tutor I was looking for a good tripod, After a review opinion, I ordered this tripod n I feel I have taken a good decision.Planning to get a bigger one of same kind of it’s available.

A good alternative of gorilla pod
"
2277,"
Nice professional look more flexible

"

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.
"
2280,"
It's was worth buying this over the other fake varients... Its much better.. Telling after seeing and using both.Its well worth your money

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
2288,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
2289,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
2290,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
2291,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
2292,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba
"
2293,"
De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

Es un buen producto que cumple con su función, por el precio que pagas creo que está bien pero creo que sería mucho mejor, es una buena compra si piensas usarla para cosas simples, pero si quieres algo más elaborado entonces si recomiendo buscar otra opción

This really is a good simple charger. And like most others this actually comes with the cord and the box to plug it in to charge. I have a 13 pro max. Now it won’t fit in with a case on it standing straight. But if you turn it sideways it will still charge. Without the case in it fits just fine. And it’s metal or some sort of metal. Definitely durable.

Move 2, 2022 update: wireless charger completely stopped working 8 days after initial use. Exchanging. Hopefully the next one will last a bit longer...Although I asked questions, I got no response from the seller, so I thought I'd purchase one of these and check it out.One question I asked was whether this charger supports Qi EPP (Extended Power Profile), which is the standard promulgated by the Wireless Power Consortium for fast (15W) wireless charging. This standard is primarily used by Google Pixel and Sony Xperia and LG phones. There is nothing on the equipment (stand or included adapter), box, or documentation that suggests it supports Qi EPP.I asked which Pixel phones this charger supports because the product description says it supports ""15W for some Pixel and LG phones."" There is nothing on the box to suggest that it supports Pixel or LG phones at all. However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.

After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.
"
2321,"
I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.
"
2322,"
Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.
"
2323,"
The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.

I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.
"
2325,"
This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.
"
2326,"
This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

I received my Intoval Wireless Charing Stand Y3 last Friday from Amazon and I have to say this thing is amazing. It is very well constructed out of aluminum giving it a very premium feal to it. You can charge your phone either standing up or sideways. It also comes with a wall charger and a USB A (which plugs into the charger) to USB C (which plug into the stand. I have the Gun Grey one which matches really well with my MacBook Pro. This is a fast charging stand with an output rating of 5W/7.5W/10W/15W. I did not run into any issues charging my iPhone 13 Pro Max.The only thing of note is that the cord that comes with the unit is a little on the smaller side. If you need a longer cord, then you may want to order a longer USB A cable with this, as the one that comes with it, is only about 3 feet long. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry.
"

This wireless charging stand was exactly what I was looking for my desk at the office. It isn't the most stylish thing to look at, but it does it's job. It came with a wall charger piece to go with the charging cord, which was very convenient. I like that it charges the phone in either a vertical or horizontal position. It's wide enough so I can charge my Galaxy S22 phone with it's slim case on. I wish it came in a true black color as I'd like to purchase another.

This is a quality made aluminum phone charging stand. I got the silver one and it's the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro with an Otterbox cover. It's narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space and it charged my phone from 64% to 100% in an hour and :45 minutes. A nice feature is that it came ready to use - it included the charger cord and electric outlet plug, so no rooting around for an adapter to make it work. The phone actually sits a little higher on this charger, but I've found the weight of the phone seems to keep it stabilized. All said, a nice product.
"

First off, it charges about as fast as your basic charger. My husband has been using this at work for both his personal cell and his work cell. His personal phone has a protective Rhinoshield case while his work phone (pictured) has an Otterbox. It will charge his work phone through the case, but it doesn’t fit vertically unless you balance it like we have pictured. We ordered it specifically for his personal phone, and it fits inside perfectly fine. It charges in both orientations and through both cases.
"
2341,"
Item arrived looking just like the picture.  I ordered it to put on my kitchen counter to meet a couple of needs.  I wanted something to hold the phone upright when cooking/following a recipe and I also wanted to be able to charge it because I always seem to find that I have low power when I need it for a while.  I unboxed it, plugged it in, and was good to go.  I holds and charges my iphone 12 pro without issue in both a vertical and horizontal position which was a bonus.  So far it has completely met my needs.
"
2342,"
I really like this charger for many reasons.-It is a single formed piece of metal. There are no hinges to collapse or fail unexpectedly. No plastic to crack. Because of this design, it's not meant to be portable though.-The metal is very rigid but also very thin which gives it a sleek unobtrusive look.-I have the green color which has a nice shiny metallic finish.-The charging port is your generic USB-C which goes straight out the back allowing you to hide the cable.-The main negative is that the width is limited if you want to set your phone vertically. 85mm is what I measured as the maximum width. My Galaxy S20 with thin case fits with room to spare. You can also place the phone horizontally but it looks a bit awkward.

I have used this for two nights and it seems to charge well. It is sturdy. The cell phone does not fall off the stand and it has given me extra room on my bedside table. The color pink is gorgeous.

Works great! My phone is able to charge on this without taking protective case off. Like that you can set it upwards or sideways. Perfect size for my nightstand. Charges fast
"
2345,"
This was super easy to install. It holds my phone either way, and even with the OtterBox case will charge it but if you do have a thicker case like an OtterBox, it won’t sit in there vertically you have to set it in there horizontally.  It does come with the AC block to plug-in which was great.

 This charging phone holder is made up of a metal that is of great quality. I am surprisingly happy with this. I’ll never buy any others if Something Happens with this I’ll buy another one. That’s how good of a quality that says and I’m not just saying that because I’m a vine reviewer, but because I’ve been using this for a week now and it has been awesome you can put your phone in it upright or you can put your phone sideways on it holds it both ways. It was is a great value durable and sturdy also.

I love this iPhone and Apple watch charger! Just drop your watch on the watch charger and it just connects! Same goes for the phone charger. No more missed connections for charging and the stand takes up less room on your table than all those cords! A great charging station.
"
2348,"
So cute, great pink color, seems like it should be a great product, but this thing is so flippin' slow to charge, it's really inexcusable. My daughter put her phone (iphone 12 pro max which is listed as a ""compatible device"") on it at 11%. 8.5 hours later, it was at 83%. This is her consistent experience with this ""charger."" Just absolutely unacceptable that any charger can't charge your phone to 100% overnight. Frankly, I don't understand the positive reviews. In our experience, this thing is essentially just a phone stand. We can't recommend.
"
2349,"
The only thing I can find to complain about is the lack of a lip or edge, to keep the phone from sliding off the front. If I wasn't trying to tap buttons on it while it sits, or if I didn't have a bracket on the back, i don't think I'd have notices. The rubbery pads work well enough for that.Charges quickly.I love the two orientations.

So they did a couple of updatesBetter camera ( not great )Crease still very visible , I mean come on , surly the design of the screen could have been improved. Aspect ratio just feels all wrongBattery life betterBut overall not worth the upgrade for what your paying ( your paying to flip a screen) nothing more
"
2356,"
I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.
"

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

I like it, I was a really big fan of my S10 and replaced it with this. Sometimes having the big screen with a pen is really handy, and I like to play games and there's all sort of nifty stuff you can do with Xbox controllers, a pc and the phone combined if you're interested. Battery drains kinda fast if your on the big screen watching videos, etc. I don't have any issues with the bend in the middle. People that say ""I don't even see it!"" Are bs'ing you, you'll notice it. If the brightness is up its not a huge deal, but if your looking at something mono-colored or just very dark, it's pretty obvious. Still, having a phone that opens up into a tablet is pretty cool. I'm pretty tech-savvy and I still don't know how to get the most out of the whole dual left right screen thing. Also certain apps close/reset when you unfold. So if you're on ig watching some video and think ""I wanna see this bigger"" and unfold, it's gone and you'll probably never find where you were.

This device is not perfect, but after using it even a short while, I can never go back.  It would be great if there were more competition in this space.  I'd ask for less bulk, no divot in the middle (a sharp break or crease would be preferred), and maybe a built in pen like the galaxy note.

The over reviews made me wary of making a big purchase but my experience has been awesome in the last 2weeks. I bought a case, camera lens cover & stylus with the phone.Compared to my old iphone, the camera quality is great, the voice clarity is better and the battery life is more than adequate. I'm a medium user, but I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day and the charging is fast. Modern tech isn't rugged hence the case. If I had more cash to spend, i'd definitely buy this again! 5 stars

The foldable phones are disposable. Don't just take my word for it, Google stress fractures and factory installed screen protectors falling off after a few months. Basically, your folding screen will fail in less than a year. Then your carrier says you need to contact Samsung who will offer to let you send the phone in for repair indefinitely or you can drive to a service center and spend all day while they fix it. They sell you a garbage product and they know it will fail so they intentionally give poor support hoping you will give up. Stay away!

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.

I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.

I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.

I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
2408,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
2409,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)

My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
2412,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
2413,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.

I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!

When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
2416,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
2417,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!

Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
2421,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"

Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.

Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"

Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
2425,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...

We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.

Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"

Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
2433,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"

It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.

This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!

This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
2437,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
2438,"
Perfect for cameras
"
2439,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
2440,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
2441,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
2442,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
2443,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
2444,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
2445,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
2446,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
2447,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
2448,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
2449,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
2450,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
2451,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
2452,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
2453,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
2454,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
2455,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
2456,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
2457,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
2458,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
2459,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
2460,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
2461,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
2462,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
2463,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
2464,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
2465,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
2466,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
2467,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
2468,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
2469,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
2470,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
2471,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
2472,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
2473,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
2474,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
2475,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
2476,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
2477,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
2478,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
2479,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
2480,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
2481,"
Great product!
"
2482,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
2483,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
2484,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
2485,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
2486,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
2487,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
2488,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
2489,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
2490,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
2491,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
2492,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
2493,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
2494,"
Good
"
2495,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
2496,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
2497,"
Versatility
"
2498,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
2499,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
2500,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
2501,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
2502,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
2503,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
2504,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
2505,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
2506,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
2507,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
2508,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
2509,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
2510,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨
"
2511,"
Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

My Grandson uses it for You tube

 Leg broke at base , really sad because this thing is awesome
"
2514,"
Easy to use
"
2515,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
2516,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
2517,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
2518,"
Great product
"
2519,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
2520,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
2521,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
2522,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
2523,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
2524,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
2525,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
2526,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
2527,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
2528,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
2529,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
2530,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
2531,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
2532,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
2533,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
2534,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
2535,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
2536,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
2537,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
2538,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
2539,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
2540,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
2541,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
2542,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
2543,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
2544,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
2545,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
2546,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
2547,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
2548,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
2549,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
2550,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
2551,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
2552,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
2553,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
2554,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
2555,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
2556,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
2557,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
2558,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
2559,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
2560,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
2561,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
2562,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
2563,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title
"
2564,"
These hold up my phone and projector perfectly.

I love it and if needed i would shop again from this vendor
"
2567,"
Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
2568,"
The best !!!!!
"
2569,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
2570,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
2571,"
I love it
"
2572,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
2573,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
2574,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing

2578,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone

Love this for our Gopro Hero 7! It is so much more sturdy than the other options in this style. Definitely recommend it!
"
2580,"
Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.
"

Buen material y muy funcional...

2583,"

"
2584,"
Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
2585,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
2586,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
2587,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
2588,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy
"
2589,"
Just received it and tested out today while our family doing camping over the weekend , this is good product guys , high quality stuff :-)
"
2590,"
Perfect in any situation holds my dslr canon 60D and the clip holds bloggie touch and I phone. Great value
"
2591,"
Exactly what I was looking for! Works perfect for my iPhone and my large DSLR. The legs are super moldable but sturdy. I love it!
"
2592,"
Love it !! Use it for work outs or for work when i need to make how to videos .
"
2593,"
I love it soo much. I'm using it for my iPhone and my DSLR canon camera.
"
2594,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
2595,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
2596,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!

The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
2607,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"

Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.
"
2617,"
Loved this tripod!!! It’s very sturdy

I really love this tripod! The flexible legs are so awesome! Great value for the money!!
"
2625,"
Best tripod ever,very sturdy and, comfortable grip.
"
2626,"
This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
2627,"
Amazing product
"
2628,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"

Cute and sturdy
"
2630,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
2631,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
2632,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
2633,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
2634,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
2635,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
2636,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
2637,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
2638,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"

I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

2657,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.
"
2659,"
It is very flexible & convenient!

"
2669,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
2670,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
2671,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
2672,"
Feels very durable!

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
2698,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
2699,"
I really like it
"
2700,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
2701,"
Wow
"
2702,"
Good
"
2703,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
2704,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
2705,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
2706,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
2707,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
2708,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
2709,"
Stiff
"
2710,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

have used for only a few months and have two legs broken!!

"
2717,"
using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
2718,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
2719,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
2720,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
2721,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
2722,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
2723,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
2724,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
2725,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
2726,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
2727,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
2728,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

Very handy and versatile tripod! Will order again as a gift because I want my family and friends to have this
"

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
2733,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
2734,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
2735,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
2736,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
2737,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
2738,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"
2739,"
perfect tripod
"
2740,"
Love using this hold the camera for videos or to set up a tripod.
"

Works on anything your trying to film from
"

Works as advertised, lightweight great for the trails
"
2746,"
This is my second one. I used the hell out of the other one
"
2747,"
A must have for vlogs!
"
2748,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
2749,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
2750,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
2751,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
2752,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
2753,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"
2754,"
Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!
"
2755,"
My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩
"
2756,"
Perfect
"
2757,"
You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
2758,"
It's worth recommending
"
2759,"
It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
2760,"
Es muy estable
"
2761,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
2762,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
2763,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
2764,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
2765,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
2766,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
2767,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
2768,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
2769,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
2770,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
2771,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
2772,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
2773,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
2774,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
2775,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
2776,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
2777,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
2778,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
2779,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
2780,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
2781,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
2782,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
2783,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
2784,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
2785,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
2786,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
2787,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
2788,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
2789,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
2790,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
2791,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"
2792,"
I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.
"
2793,"
Me gustó, muy útil para varias posiciones y aguanta perfecto una réflex
"
2794,"
Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"
2795,"
I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
2796,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
2797,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.
"
2798,"
Excelente producto, me encantó y muy resistente.
"
2799,"
No aguanta mucho el peso de la cámara
"
2800,"

Es un gran producto el mejor que he hecho hasta ahora, espero en un futuro comprar la version 2 de este tripie
"
2802,"
Love it, I 've had it for a while. love using it whenever I'm vlogging
"
2803,"
Esta increíble, no pesa y lo puedes llevar a cualquier lado! Súper fácil de utilizar. Yo lo utilizo con mi cámara Eos sin problema de peso.

Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
2875,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
2876,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
2877,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
2878,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"

This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
2897,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
2898,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
2899,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"

Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.

Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)
"
2929,"
I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!
"
2930,"
This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.
"
2933,"
El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.
"
2934,"
Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
2935,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

"

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"
2947,"
I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
2948,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
2949,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
2950,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
2951,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
2952,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
2953,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"
2954,"
I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
2955,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
2956,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
2957,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.
"
2958,"
I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
2959,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
2960,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
2961,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
2962,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
2963,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
2964,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend

This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.

Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.

Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
2968,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
2969,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
2970,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
2971,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
2972,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
2973,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
2974,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
2975,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
2976,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
2977,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
2978,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
2979,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
2980,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
2981,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
2982,"
Perfect for cameras
"
2983,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
2984,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
2985,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
2986,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
2987,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
2988,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
2989,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
2990,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
2991,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
2992,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
2993,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
2994,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
2995,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
2996,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
2997,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
2998,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
2999,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
3000,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
3001,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
3002,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
3003,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
3004,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
3005,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
3006,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
3007,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
3008,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
3009,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
3010,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
3011,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
3012,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
3013,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
3014,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
3015,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
3016,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
3017,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
3018,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
3019,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
3020,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
3021,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
3022,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
3023,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
3024,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
3025,"
Great product!
"
3026,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
3027,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
3028,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
3029,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
3030,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
3031,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
3032,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
3033,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
3034,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
3035,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
3036,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
3037,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
3038,"
Good
"
3039,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
3040,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
3041,"
Versatility
"
3042,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
3043,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
3044,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
3045,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
3046,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
3047,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
3048,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
3049,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
3050,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
3051,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
3052,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
3053,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
3054,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨

Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
3060,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
3061,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
3062,"
Great product
"
3063,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
3064,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
3065,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
3066,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
3067,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
3068,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
3069,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
3070,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
3071,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
3072,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
3073,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
3074,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
3075,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
3076,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
3077,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
3078,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
3079,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
3080,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
3081,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
3082,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
3083,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
3084,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
3085,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
3086,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
3087,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
3088,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
3089,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
3090,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
3091,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
3092,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
3093,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
3094,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
3095,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
3096,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
3097,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
3098,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"

Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.

"
3104,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
3105,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"

This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
3107,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title

The best !!!!!
"
3113,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
3114,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
3115,"

3132,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy

Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
3139,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
3140,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
3141,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"
3142,"
Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
3150,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
3151,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
3152,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
3153,"
Love it.
"
3154,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.
"
3161,"
Loved this tripod!!! It’s very sturdy
"

I really love this tripod! The flexible legs are so awesome! Great value for the money!!
"

Best tripod ever,very sturdy and, comfortable grip.

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
3171,"
Amazing product
"
3172,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
3173,"
Cute and sturdy
"
3174,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
3175,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
3176,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
3177,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
3178,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
3179,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
3180,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
3181,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
3182,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"
3183,"
I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

3201,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.
"
3203,"
It is very flexible & convenient!

"
3212,"
Excellent
"
3213,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
3214,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
3215,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
3216,"
Feels very durable!

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
3242,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
3243,"
I really like it
"
3244,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
3245,"
Wow
"
3246,"
Good
"
3247,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
3248,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
3249,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
3250,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
3251,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
3252,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
3253,"
Stiff
"
3254,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"
3255,"
have used for only a few months and have two legs broken!!

"
3261,"
using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
3262,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
3263,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
3264,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
3265,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
3266,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
3267,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
3268,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
3269,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
3270,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
3271,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
3272,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
3277,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
3278,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
3279,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
3280,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
3281,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
3282,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"
3283,"
perfect tripod

3284,"
Love using this hold the camera for videos or to set up a tripod.

This is my second one. I used the hell out of the other one
"
3291,"
A must have for vlogs!
"
3292,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
3293,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
3294,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
3295,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
3296,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
3297,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"
3298,"
Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!
"

My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩

Perfect
"
3301,"
You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
3302,"
It's worth recommending
"
3303,"
It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
3304,"
Es muy estable
"
3305,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
3306,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
3307,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
3308,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
3309,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
3310,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
3311,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
3312,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
3313,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
3314,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
3315,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
3316,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
3317,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
3318,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
3319,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado

I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.

Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"

I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
3323,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
3324,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
3325,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"

Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
3327,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.

Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.

Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
3331,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
3332,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
3333,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
3334,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.

Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.

I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.

Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
3340,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
3341,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
3419,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
3420,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
3421,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
3422,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
3423,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
3441,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
3442,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
3443,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
3444,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
3445,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba

De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

Es un buen producto que cumple con su función, por el precio que pagas creo que está bien pero creo que sería mucho mejor, es una buena compra si piensas usarla para cosas simples, pero si quieres algo más elaborado entonces si recomiendo buscar otra opción

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.
"
3470,"
This really is a good simple charger. And like most others this actually comes with the cord and the box to plug it in to charge. I have a 13 pro max. Now it won’t fit in with a case on it standing straight. But if you turn it sideways it will still charge. Without the case in it fits just fine. And it’s metal or some sort of metal. Definitely durable.
"

Easy to use, a great product for sure.

Move 2, 2022 update: wireless charger completely stopped working 8 days after initial use. Exchanging. Hopefully the next one will last a bit longer...Although I asked questions, I got no response from the seller, so I thought I'd purchase one of these and check it out.One question I asked was whether this charger supports Qi EPP (Extended Power Profile), which is the standard promulgated by the Wireless Power Consortium for fast (15W) wireless charging. This standard is primarily used by Google Pixel and Sony Xperia and LG phones. There is nothing on the equipment (stand or included adapter), box, or documentation that suggests it supports Qi EPP.I asked which Pixel phones this charger supports because the product description says it supports ""15W for some Pixel and LG phones."" There is nothing on the box to suggest that it supports Pixel or LG phones at all. However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.
"

After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.
"
3474,"
I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.
"
3475,"
The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.
"
3476,"
Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.
"
3477,"
I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.
"
3478,"
This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.
"
3479,"
This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.

Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.

I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.

This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.

This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

I received my Intoval Wireless Charing Stand Y3 last Friday from Amazon and I have to say this thing is amazing. It is very well constructed out of aluminum giving it a very premium feal to it. You can charge your phone either standing up or sideways. It also comes with a wall charger and a USB A (which plugs into the charger) to USB C (which plug into the stand. I have the Gun Grey one which matches really well with my MacBook Pro. This is a fast charging stand with an output rating of 5W/7.5W/10W/15W. I did not run into any issues charging my iPhone 13 Pro Max.The only thing of note is that the cord that comes with the unit is a little on the smaller side. If you need a longer cord, then you may want to order a longer USB A cable with this, as the one that comes with it, is only about 3 feet long. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry.

This wireless charging stand was exactly what I was looking for my desk at the office. It isn't the most stylish thing to look at, but it does it's job. It came with a wall charger piece to go with the charging cord, which was very convenient. I like that it charges the phone in either a vertical or horizontal position. It's wide enough so I can charge my Galaxy S22 phone with it's slim case on. I wish it came in a true black color as I'd like to purchase another.

This is a quality made aluminum phone charging stand. I got the silver one and it's the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro with an Otterbox cover. It's narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space and it charged my phone from 64% to 100% in an hour and :45 minutes. A nice feature is that it came ready to use - it included the charger cord and electric outlet plug, so no rooting around for an adapter to make it work. The phone actually sits a little higher on this charger, but I've found the weight of the phone seems to keep it stabilized. All said, a nice product.
"

First off, it charges about as fast as your basic charger. My husband has been using this at work for both his personal cell and his work cell. His personal phone has a protective Rhinoshield case while his work phone (pictured) has an Otterbox. It will charge his work phone through the case, but it doesn’t fit vertically unless you balance it like we have pictured. We ordered it specifically for his personal phone, and it fits inside perfectly fine. It charges in both orientations and through both cases.
"

Item arrived looking just like the picture.  I ordered it to put on my kitchen counter to meet a couple of needs.  I wanted something to hold the phone upright when cooking/following a recipe and I also wanted to be able to charge it because I always seem to find that I have low power when I need it for a while.  I unboxed it, plugged it in, and was good to go.  I holds and charges my iphone 12 pro without issue in both a vertical and horizontal position which was a bonus.  So far it has completely met my needs.
"

I really like this charger for many reasons.-It is a single formed piece of metal. There are no hinges to collapse or fail unexpectedly. No plastic to crack. Because of this design, it's not meant to be portable though.-The metal is very rigid but also very thin which gives it a sleek unobtrusive look.-I have the green color which has a nice shiny metallic finish.-The charging port is your generic USB-C which goes straight out the back allowing you to hide the cable.-The main negative is that the width is limited if you want to set your phone vertically. 85mm is what I measured as the maximum width. My Galaxy S20 with thin case fits with room to spare. You can also place the phone horizontally but it looks a bit awkward.
"
3496,"
This was super easy to install. It holds my phone either way, and even with the OtterBox case will charge it but if you do have a thicker case like an OtterBox, it won’t sit in there vertically you have to set it in there horizontally.  It does come with the AC block to plug-in which was great.

I have used this for two nights and it seems to charge well. It is sturdy. The cell phone does not fall off the stand and it has given me extra room on my bedside table. The color pink is gorgeous.

Works great! My phone is able to charge on this without taking protective case off. Like that you can set it upwards or sideways. Perfect size for my nightstand. Charges fast

 This charging phone holder is made up of a metal that is of great quality. I am surprisingly happy with this. I’ll never buy any others if Something Happens with this I’ll buy another one. That’s how good of a quality that says and I’m not just saying that because I’m a vine reviewer, but because I’ve been using this for a week now and it has been awesome you can put your phone in it upright or you can put your phone sideways on it holds it both ways. It was is a great value durable and sturdy also.

I love this iPhone and Apple watch charger! Just drop your watch on the watch charger and it just connects! Same goes for the phone charger. No more missed connections for charging and the stand takes up less room on your table than all those cords! A great charging station.
"
3501,"
So cute, great pink color, seems like it should be a great product, but this thing is so flippin' slow to charge, it's really inexcusable. My daughter put her phone (iphone 12 pro max which is listed as a ""compatible device"") on it at 11%. 8.5 hours later, it was at 83%. This is her consistent experience with this ""charger."" Just absolutely unacceptable that any charger can't charge your phone to 100% overnight. Frankly, I don't understand the positive reviews. In our experience, this thing is essentially just a phone stand. We can't recommend.
"
3502,"
The only thing I can find to complain about is the lack of a lip or edge, to keep the phone from sliding off the front. If I wasn't trying to tap buttons on it while it sits, or if I didn't have a bracket on the back, i don't think I'd have notices. The rubbery pads work well enough for that.Charges quickly.I love the two orientations.

I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

I like it, I was a really big fan of my S10 and replaced it with this. Sometimes having the big screen with a pen is really handy, and I like to play games and there's all sort of nifty stuff you can do with Xbox controllers, a pc and the phone combined if you're interested. Battery drains kinda fast if your on the big screen watching videos, etc. I don't have any issues with the bend in the middle. People that say ""I don't even see it!"" Are bs'ing you, you'll notice it. If the brightness is up its not a huge deal, but if your looking at something mono-colored or just very dark, it's pretty obvious. Still, having a phone that opens up into a tablet is pretty cool. I'm pretty tech-savvy and I still don't know how to get the most out of the whole dual left right screen thing. Also certain apps close/reset when you unfold. So if you're on ig watching some video and think ""I wanna see this bigger"" and unfold, it's gone and you'll probably never find where you were.

This device is not perfect, but after using it even a short while, I can never go back.  It would be great if there were more competition in this space.  I'd ask for less bulk, no divot in the middle (a sharp break or crease would be preferred), and maybe a built in pen like the galaxy note.

The over reviews made me wary of making a big purchase but my experience has been awesome in the last 2weeks. I bought a case, camera lens cover & stylus with the phone.Compared to my old iphone, the camera quality is great, the voice clarity is better and the battery life is more than adequate. I'm a medium user, but I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day and the charging is fast. Modern tech isn't rugged hence the case. If I had more cash to spend, i'd definitely buy this again! 5 stars

The foldable phones are disposable. Don't just take my word for it, Google stress fractures and factory installed screen protectors falling off after a few months. Basically, your folding screen will fail in less than a year. Then your carrier says you need to contact Samsung who will offer to let you send the phone in for repair indefinitely or you can drive to a service center and spend all day while they fix it. They sell you a garbage product and they know it will fail so they intentionally give poor support hoping you will give up. Stay away!

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

Needed a way to shoot XXX looking down at a angel. Use this on top of bed post using camcorder and works perfect.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
3554,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.
"
3555,"
Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
3557,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
3558,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
3559,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"

I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
3561,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
3562,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"
3563,"
I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
3564,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
3565,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
3566,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.
"
3567,"
I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
3568,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
3569,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
3570,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
3571,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
3572,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
3573,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
3574,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
3575,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
3576,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
3577,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
3578,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
3579,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
3580,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
3581,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
3582,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
3583,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
3584,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
3585,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
3586,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
3587,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
3588,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
3589,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
3590,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
3591,"
Perfect for cameras
"
3592,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
3593,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
3594,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
3595,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
3596,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
3597,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
3598,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
3599,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
3600,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
3601,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
3602,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
3603,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
3604,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
3605,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
3606,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
3607,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
3608,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
3609,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
3610,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
3611,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
3612,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
3613,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
3614,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
3615,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
3616,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
3617,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
3618,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
3619,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
3620,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
3621,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
3622,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
3623,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
3624,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
3625,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
3626,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
3627,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
3628,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
3629,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
3630,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
3631,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
3632,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
3633,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
3634,"
Great product!
"
3635,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
3636,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
3637,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
3638,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
3639,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
3640,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
3641,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
3642,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
3643,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
3644,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
3645,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
3646,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.

Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
3649,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
3650,"
Versatility
"
3651,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
3652,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
3653,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
3654,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
3655,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
3656,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
3657,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
3658,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
3659,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
3660,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
3661,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
3662,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
3663,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨
"

Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

 Leg broke at base , really sad because this thing is awesome
"
3667,"
Easy to use
"
3668,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
3669,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
3670,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
3671,"
Great product
"
3672,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
3673,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
3674,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
3675,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
3676,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
3677,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
3678,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
3679,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
3680,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
3681,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
3682,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
3683,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
3684,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
3685,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
3686,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
3687,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
3688,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
3689,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
3690,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
3691,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
3692,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
3693,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
3694,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
3695,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
3696,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
3697,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
3698,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
3699,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
3700,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
3701,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
3702,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
3703,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
3704,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
3705,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
3706,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
3707,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
3708,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
3709,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
3710,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
3711,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
3712,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
3713,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
3714,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
3715,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
3716,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title
"
3717,"
These hold up my phone and projector perfectly.
"
3718,"
functional and as described, would recommend.
"
3719,"
I love it and if needed i would shop again from this vendor
"
3720,"
Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
3721,"
The best !!!!!
"
3722,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
3723,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
3724,"
I love it
"
3725,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
3726,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
3727,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing
"
3728,"
Love using this tripod.
"
3729,"
It fits my LUMIX Fz300 perfectly! I’m loving this tripod. It also feels very safe for my camera.
"
3730,"
I love this product! Flexible, Sturdy and can be used with DSLR and iPhone camera! Love love love
"
3731,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone
"
3732,"
Love this for our Gopro Hero 7! It is so much more sturdy than the other options in this style. Definitely recommend it!
"
3733,"
Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.
"
3734,"
Buen material y muy funcional...
"
3735,"
My grandson loved it
"
3736,"
It is very sturdy and actually holds my camera which has an attached  lens
"
3737,"
Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
3738,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
3739,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
3740,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
3741,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy
"
3742,"

"
3743,"
Perfect in any situation holds my dslr canon 60D and the clip holds bloggie touch and I phone. Great value
"
3744,"
Exactly what I was looking for! Works perfect for my iPhone and my large DSLR. The legs are super moldable but sturdy. I love it!
"
3745,"
Love it !! Use it for work outs or for work when i need to make how to videos .
"
3746,"
I love it soo much. I'm using it for my iPhone and my DSLR canon camera.
"
3747,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
3748,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
3749,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
3750,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"
3751,"
Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

I’m loving my tripod. It’s really easy to use. I use it to record my workouts and it’s so versatile!!!
"

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
3759,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
3760,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
3761,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
3762,"
Love it.
"
3763,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
3780,"
Amazing product
"
3781,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
3782,"
Cute and sturdy
"
3783,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
3784,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
3785,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
3786,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
3787,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
3788,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
3789,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
3790,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
3791,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"
3792,"
I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

It has worked great on our recent trip. Good product.

3809,"
Love it
"
3810,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.
"
3812,"
It is very flexible & convenient!

This is perfect item! Durable, the right size..
"
3821,"
Excellent
"
3822,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
3823,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
3824,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
3825,"
Feels very durable!
"
3826,"
Excellent quality from this tripod. Full recommended.
"
3827,"
Alike a lot
"

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
3851,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
3852,"
I really like it
"
3853,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
3854,"
Wow
"
3855,"
Good
"
3856,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
3857,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
3858,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
3859,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
3860,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
3861,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
3862,"
Stiff
"
3863,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please
"

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
3871,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
3872,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
3873,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
3874,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.

Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.

This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
3877,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
3878,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
3879,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"

I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
3886,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
3887,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
3888,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
3889,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
3890,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"

Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.

A must have for vlogs!
"
3901,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
3902,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
3903,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
3904,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
3905,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"

It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
3913,"

The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
3915,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
3916,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
3917,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
3918,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
3919,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
3920,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
3921,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
3922,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
3923,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
3924,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
3925,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
3926,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
3927,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
3928,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
3929,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
3930,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
3931,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
3932,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
3933,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
3934,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
3935,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
3936,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
3937,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
3938,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
3939,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
3940,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
3941,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
3942,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
3943,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
3944,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"

I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.

"

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
3949,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
3950,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
4028,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
4029,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
4030,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
4031,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"

This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

"

I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
4051,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
4052,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
4053,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
4054,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba

De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
4088,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
4101,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
4102,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
4103,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
4104,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
4105,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
4106,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"
4107,"
I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
4108,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
4109,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
4110,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.
"
4111,"
I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
4112,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
4113,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
4114,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
4115,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
4116,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
4117,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
4118,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
4119,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
4120,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
4121,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
4122,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
4123,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
4124,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
4125,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
4126,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
4127,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
4128,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
4129,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
4130,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
4131,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
4132,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
4133,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
4134,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
4135,"
Perfect for cameras
"
4136,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
4137,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
4138,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
4139,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
4140,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
4141,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
4142,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
4143,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
4144,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
4145,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
4146,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
4147,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
4148,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
4149,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
4150,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
4151,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
4152,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
4153,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
4154,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
4155,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
4156,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
4157,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
4158,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
4159,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
4160,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
4161,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
4162,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
4163,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
4164,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
4165,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod

I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
4168,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
4169,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
4170,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
4171,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
4172,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
4173,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
4174,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
4175,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
4176,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
4177,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
4178,"
Great product!
"
4179,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
4180,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
4181,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
4182,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
4183,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
4184,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
4185,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
4186,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
4187,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
4188,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
4189,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
4190,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
4191,"
Good
"
4192,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
4193,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
4194,"
Versatility
"
4195,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
4196,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
4197,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
4198,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
4199,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
4200,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
4201,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
4202,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
4203,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
4204,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
4205,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
4206,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
4207,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨
"
4208,"
Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

 Leg broke at base , really sad because this thing is awesome
"
4211,"
Easy to use
"
4212,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
4213,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
4214,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
4215,"
Great product
"
4216,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
4217,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
4218,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
4219,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
4220,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
4221,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
4222,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
4223,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
4224,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
4225,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
4226,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
4227,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
4228,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
4229,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
4230,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
4231,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
4232,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
4233,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
4234,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
4235,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
4236,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
4237,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
4238,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
4239,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
4240,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
4241,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
4242,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
4243,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
4244,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
4245,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
4246,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
4247,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
4248,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
4249,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
4250,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
4251,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
4252,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
4253,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
4254,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
4255,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
4256,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
4257,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
4258,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
4259,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
4260,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title
"
4261,"
These hold up my phone and projector perfectly.
"
4262,"
functional and as described, would recommend.
"
4263,"
I love it and if needed i would shop again from this vendor
"
4264,"
Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
4265,"
The best !!!!!
"
4266,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
4267,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
4268,"
I love it
"
4269,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
4270,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
4271,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing
"
4272,"

I love this product! Flexible, Sturdy and can be used with DSLR and iPhone camera! Love love love
"
4275,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone
"
4276,"
Love this for our Gopro Hero 7! It is so much more sturdy than the other options in this style. Definitely recommend it!
"
4277,"
Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.
"
4278,"
Buen material y muy funcional...
"

"
4281,"
Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
4282,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
4283,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
4284,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
4285,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy
"
4286,"
Just received it and tested out today while our family doing camping over the weekend , this is good product guys , high quality stuff :-)
"
4287,"
Perfect in any situation holds my dslr canon 60D and the clip holds bloggie touch and I phone. Great value
"
4288,"
Exactly what I was looking for! Works perfect for my iPhone and my large DSLR. The legs are super moldable but sturdy. I love it!
"
4289,"
Love it !! Use it for work outs or for work when i need to make how to videos .
"
4290,"
I love it soo much. I'm using it for my iPhone and my DSLR canon camera.
"
4291,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
4292,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
4293,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
4294,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!
"
4295,"
Great for bloggers my YouTube is Life of Dionne

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
4303,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
4304,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
4305,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
4306,"
Love it.
"
4307,"
speedy delivery and it looks exactly as advertized. I cannot wait to start vlogging

4325,"
So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
4326,"
Cute and sturdy
"
4327,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
4328,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
4329,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
4330,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
4331,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
4332,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
4333,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
4334,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
4335,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"
4336,"
I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

It has worked great on our recent trip. Good product.

4353,"

4354,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.
"
4356,"
It is very flexible & convenient!

"
4365,"
Excellent
"
4366,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
4367,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.

I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
4395,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
4396,"
I really like it
"
4397,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
4398,"
Wow
"
4399,"
Good
"
4400,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
4401,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
4402,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
4403,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
4404,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
4405,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
4406,"
Stiff

It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
4415,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
4416,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
4417,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
4418,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
4419,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
4420,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
4421,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
4422,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
4423,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
4424,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
4425,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

Very handy and versatile tripod! Will order again as a gift because I want my family and friends to have this
"
4429,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
4430,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
4431,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
4432,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
4433,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
4434,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
4435,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.
"

A must have for vlogs!
"
4445,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
4446,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
4447,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
4448,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
4449,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
4450,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"
4451,"
Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!

My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩
"

You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
4455,"
It's worth recommending
"
4456,"
It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
4457,"
Es muy estable
"
4458,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
4459,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
4460,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
4461,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
4462,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
4463,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
4464,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
4465,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
4466,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
4467,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
4468,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
4469,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
4470,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
4471,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
4472,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
4473,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
4474,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
4475,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
4476,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
4477,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
4478,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
4479,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
4480,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
4481,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
4482,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
4483,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
4484,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
4485,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
4486,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
4487,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
4488,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"
4489,"
I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.
"
4490,"
Me gustó, muy útil para varias posiciones y aguanta perfecto una réflex
"
4491,"
Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"
4492,"
I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
4493,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
4494,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.
"
4495,"
Excelente producto, me encantó y muy resistente.
"

Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
4572,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
4573,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
4574,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
4575,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
4576,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"

I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"

I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.

First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.

Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.

Does a great job. Legs are sturdy and super flexible. Grip is a bit fiddly but works well and easily accommodates iPhone 12 Pro Max with room to spare. Very good value.

Better quality than expected! If youre looking for nice quality tripod for less this is it!! BONUS: works with camera and phones!

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

Compre este trípode para un viaje y fue de lo mejor, en tamaño, precio y muy versatil para utilizar, lo recomiendo mucho!!!

Es un buen producto que cumple con su función, por el precio que pagas creo que está bien pero creo que sería mucho mejor, es una buena compra si piensas usarla para cosas simples, pero si quieres algo más elaborado entonces si recomiendo buscar otra opción

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.
"

This really is a good simple charger. And like most others this actually comes with the cord and the box to plug it in to charge. I have a 13 pro max. Now it won’t fit in with a case on it standing straight. But if you turn it sideways it will still charge. Without the case in it fits just fine. And it’s metal or some sort of metal. Definitely durable.

Easy to use, a great product for sure.

Move 2, 2022 update: wireless charger completely stopped working 8 days after initial use. Exchanging. Hopefully the next one will last a bit longer...Although I asked questions, I got no response from the seller, so I thought I'd purchase one of these and check it out.One question I asked was whether this charger supports Qi EPP (Extended Power Profile), which is the standard promulgated by the Wireless Power Consortium for fast (15W) wireless charging. This standard is primarily used by Google Pixel and Sony Xperia and LG phones. There is nothing on the equipment (stand or included adapter), box, or documentation that suggests it supports Qi EPP.I asked which Pixel phones this charger supports because the product description says it supports ""15W for some Pixel and LG phones."" There is nothing on the box to suggest that it supports Pixel or LG phones at all. However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.

After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.
"
4627,"
I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.
"
4628,"
The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.
"
4629,"
Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.
"
4630,"
I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.
"
4631,"
This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.
"
4632,"
This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

I received my Intoval Wireless Charing Stand Y3 last Friday from Amazon and I have to say this thing is amazing. It is very well constructed out of aluminum giving it a very premium feal to it. You can charge your phone either standing up or sideways. It also comes with a wall charger and a USB A (which plugs into the charger) to USB C (which plug into the stand. I have the Gun Grey one which matches really well with my MacBook Pro. This is a fast charging stand with an output rating of 5W/7.5W/10W/15W. I did not run into any issues charging my iPhone 13 Pro Max.The only thing of note is that the cord that comes with the unit is a little on the smaller side. If you need a longer cord, then you may want to order a longer USB A cable with this, as the one that comes with it, is only about 3 feet long. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry.
"

This wireless charging stand was exactly what I was looking for my desk at the office. It isn't the most stylish thing to look at, but it does it's job. It came with a wall charger piece to go with the charging cord, which was very convenient. I like that it charges the phone in either a vertical or horizontal position. It's wide enough so I can charge my Galaxy S22 phone with it's slim case on. I wish it came in a true black color as I'd like to purchase another.
"
4645,"
This is a quality made aluminum phone charging stand. I got the silver one and it's the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro with an Otterbox cover. It's narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space and it charged my phone from 64% to 100% in an hour and :45 minutes. A nice feature is that it came ready to use - it included the charger cord and electric outlet plug, so no rooting around for an adapter to make it work. The phone actually sits a little higher on this charger, but I've found the weight of the phone seems to keep it stabilized. All said, a nice product.
"
4646,"
First off, it charges about as fast as your basic charger. My husband has been using this at work for both his personal cell and his work cell. His personal phone has a protective Rhinoshield case while his work phone (pictured) has an Otterbox. It will charge his work phone through the case, but it doesn’t fit vertically unless you balance it like we have pictured. We ordered it specifically for his personal phone, and it fits inside perfectly fine. It charges in both orientations and through both cases.
"
4647,"
Item arrived looking just like the picture.  I ordered it to put on my kitchen counter to meet a couple of needs.  I wanted something to hold the phone upright when cooking/following a recipe and I also wanted to be able to charge it because I always seem to find that I have low power when I need it for a while.  I unboxed it, plugged it in, and was good to go.  I holds and charges my iphone 12 pro without issue in both a vertical and horizontal position which was a bonus.  So far it has completely met my needs.
"
4648,"
I really like this charger for many reasons.-It is a single formed piece of metal. There are no hinges to collapse or fail unexpectedly. No plastic to crack. Because of this design, it's not meant to be portable though.-The metal is very rigid but also very thin which gives it a sleek unobtrusive look.-I have the green color which has a nice shiny metallic finish.-The charging port is your generic USB-C which goes straight out the back allowing you to hide the cable.-The main negative is that the width is limited if you want to set your phone vertically. 85mm is what I measured as the maximum width. My Galaxy S20 with thin case fits with room to spare. You can also place the phone horizontally but it looks a bit awkward.
"
4649,"
This was super easy to install. It holds my phone either way, and even with the OtterBox case will charge it but if you do have a thicker case like an OtterBox, it won’t sit in there vertically you have to set it in there horizontally.  It does come with the AC block to plug-in which was great.
"
4650,"
I have used this for two nights and it seems to charge well. It is sturdy. The cell phone does not fall off the stand and it has given me extra room on my bedside table. The color pink is gorgeous.
"

Works great! My phone is able to charge on this without taking protective case off. Like that you can set it upwards or sideways. Perfect size for my nightstand. Charges fast

 This charging phone holder is made up of a metal that is of great quality. I am surprisingly happy with this. I’ll never buy any others if Something Happens with this I’ll buy another one. That’s how good of a quality that says and I’m not just saying that because I’m a vine reviewer, but because I’ve been using this for a week now and it has been awesome you can put your phone in it upright or you can put your phone sideways on it holds it both ways. It was is a great value durable and sturdy also.

I love this iPhone and Apple watch charger! Just drop your watch on the watch charger and it just connects! Same goes for the phone charger. No more missed connections for charging and the stand takes up less room on your table than all those cords! A great charging station.
"
4654,"
So cute, great pink color, seems like it should be a great product, but this thing is so flippin' slow to charge, it's really inexcusable. My daughter put her phone (iphone 12 pro max which is listed as a ""compatible device"") on it at 11%. 8.5 hours later, it was at 83%. This is her consistent experience with this ""charger."" Just absolutely unacceptable that any charger can't charge your phone to 100% overnight. Frankly, I don't understand the positive reviews. In our experience, this thing is essentially just a phone stand. We can't recommend.
"
4655,"
The only thing I can find to complain about is the lack of a lip or edge, to keep the phone from sliding off the front. If I wasn't trying to tap buttons on it while it sits, or if I didn't have a bracket on the back, i don't think I'd have notices. The rubbery pads work well enough for that.Charges quickly.I love the two orientations.

So they did a couple of updatesBetter camera ( not great )Crease still very visible , I mean come on , surly the design of the screen could have been improved. Aspect ratio just feels all wrongBattery life betterBut overall not worth the upgrade for what your paying ( your paying to flip a screen) nothing more
"
4672,"
I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector. There's only a handful of places in the United States that have the necessary equipment, so if you don't live in 1 of the 4 cities in the US you're out of luck.If you contact them to fix it they might let you ship it in for 14 days to get repaired, but due to how common this is theyve recently stopped acknowledging the damage as a design problem. So it's no longer being covered under warranty. You'll have to pay like 300$ to get it replaced every 6 months and not have your phone for those 14 days.It's really frustrating because it's an otherwise great phone ruined because of terrible support from samsung. I wish I never bought it

So they did a couple of updatesBetter camera ( not great )Crease still very visible , I mean come on , surly the design of the screen could have been improved. Aspect ratio just feels all wrongBattery life betterBut overall not worth the upgrade for what your paying ( your paying to flip a screen) nothing more

I like the phone , but it does not have Dex. Dex allows you to use Samsung phone with HDMI inputs such as monitors and TV screens.I would not have this as a primary phone for my needs as the flip is kind of gimicky IMO, but...I like to use the rear camera for selfies in the folded /flip mode. Takes good photos, and I can backup photos to an USB-C memory stick  if needed, as no memory card option (although 256k internal memory).I am awaiting a high quality skin for the front screen and also the rear, on order here at AMZ.I got the phone on a two year added line with a carrier and my monthly rate plan is like a phone payment , so that was a no brainer. Can't complain about the price which is a wa$h. Not sure if it is worth $1k retail. Better primary phones out there IMO.Purchased a great Amazon a padded holster type case that loops on your belt that is padded, and would highly recommend that. Also got here a case that protects the rear hinge and the texture makes it less slippery yet protected from falls (when closed ideally). This phone will not leave my grip when in use.Disliking the nosy permissions which can Not be disabled for certain apps like Camera. Come on Samsung, Google, etc stop spying on us and selling our souls to strangers.I prefer my Sony Xperia 1 Mark 3 for photos. No itrusions by SONY, which IMO makes the highest quality phones but perhaps is trailing in their software area compared to SAMapple.

As the title suggests my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 has not been ideal.Like most people I have experienced a short battery life despite the larger battery and claims of a more power efficient chipset in this latest iteration of the Flip series. At least that's what I experienced before it started randomly power cycling or just straight up turning itself off with 70-80% of the battery charge remaining. The USB port started rejecting cables for anything other than charging even though they worked fine with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I had replaced with the Flip4 and who still worked with other devices for data transfer. All of this happened within two weeks of receiving the device.There are things I genuinely like about the Flip 4. The ability to start and stop the playback of my audiobooks without having to open the device or turn the main screen on is brilliant. I can just leave it on the desk while I work with my bluetooth earbuds in and can stop and start at a moment with no hassles. The new chipset has a much greater ability to maintain a stable 5g data connection over my previous phone which is vital to me. The ability to fold and use the camera feels great to use. It's a shame how bad of an experience I've had with the hardware.I might change my mind in the future but as of right now I would not recommend this phone. It's far too expensive to have these shortcomings and to be apparently so delicate.

The reason the screen can fold is because it's made out of soft plastic. They put another layer of slightly harder plastic on top of the base screen to protect from scratches.The harder 'screen protector' layer can only be folded for about 6 months before it starts to peel up and crack. This would be fine if samsung had ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE IT but they don't. Because of the crease you need a special machine to reapply a new protector.

I like it, I was a really big fan of my S10 and replaced it with this. Sometimes having the big screen with a pen is really handy, and I like to play games and there's all sort of nifty stuff you can do with Xbox controllers, a pc and the phone combined if you're interested. Battery drains kinda fast if your on the big screen watching videos, etc. I don't have any issues with the bend in the middle. People that say ""I don't even see it!"" Are bs'ing you, you'll notice it. If the brightness is up its not a huge deal, but if your looking at something mono-colored or just very dark, it's pretty obvious. Still, having a phone that opens up into a tablet is pretty cool. I'm pretty tech-savvy and I still don't know how to get the most out of the whole dual left right screen thing. Also certain apps close/reset when you unfold. So if you're on ig watching some video and think ""I wanna see this bigger"" and unfold, it's gone and you'll probably never find where you were.

This device is not perfect, but after using it even a short while, I can never go back.  It would be great if there were more competition in this space.  I'd ask for less bulk, no divot in the middle (a sharp break or crease would be preferred), and maybe a built in pen like the galaxy note.

The over reviews made me wary of making a big purchase but my experience has been awesome in the last 2weeks. I bought a case, camera lens cover & stylus with the phone.Compared to my old iphone, the camera quality is great, the voice clarity is better and the battery life is more than adequate. I'm a medium user, but I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day and the charging is fast. Modern tech isn't rugged hence the case. If I had more cash to spend, i'd definitely buy this again! 5 stars

The foldable phones are disposable. Don't just take my word for it, Google stress fractures and factory installed screen protectors falling off after a few months. Basically, your folding screen will fail in less than a year. Then your carrier says you need to contact Samsung who will offer to let you send the phone in for repair indefinitely or you can drive to a service center and spend all day while they fix it. They sell you a garbage product and they know it will fail so they intentionally give poor support hoping you will give up. Stay away!

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)

This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.

Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.

I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"

I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.

I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.

I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.

I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
4724,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
4725,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)

My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.
"
4728,"
Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!
"
4729,"
When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.

I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!

When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"

Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"

I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!

Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend

This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"

Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.

Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight

Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.

So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
4742,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
4743,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
4744,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
4745,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
4746,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
4747,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
4748,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
4749,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
4750,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
4751,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
4752,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
4753,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
4754,"
Perfect for cameras
"
4755,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
4756,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
4757,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
4758,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
4759,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
4760,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
4761,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
4762,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
4763,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
4764,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
4765,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
4766,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
4767,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
4768,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
4769,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
4770,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
4771,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
4772,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
4773,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
4774,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
4775,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
4776,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
4777,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
4778,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
4779,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
4780,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
4781,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
4782,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
4783,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
4784,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
4785,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
4786,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
4787,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
4788,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
4789,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
4790,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
4791,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
4792,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
4793,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
4794,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
4795,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
4796,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
4797,"
Great product!
"
4798,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
4799,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
4800,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
4801,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
4802,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
4803,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
4804,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
4805,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
4806,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
4807,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
4808,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
4809,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
4810,"
Good
"
4811,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
4812,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
4813,"
Versatility
"
4814,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
4815,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
4816,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
4817,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
4818,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
4819,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
4820,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
4821,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
4822,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
4823,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
4824,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
4825,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
4826,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨
"
4827,"
Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

"
4830,"
Easy to use
"
4831,"
Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
4832,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
4833,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
4834,"
Great product
"
4835,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
4836,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
4837,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
4838,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
4839,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
4840,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
4841,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
4842,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
4843,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
4844,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
4845,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
4846,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
4847,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
4848,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
4849,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
4850,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
4851,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
4852,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
4853,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.
"
4854,"
I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"
4855,"
Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"
4856,"
Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
4857,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
4858,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"
4859,"
Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.
"
4860,"
Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
4861,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
4862,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
4863,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
4864,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
4865,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
4866,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
4867,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
4868,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
4869,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
4870,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
4871,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
4872,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!

it would be better if the clamp extends more

4874,"

4877,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
4878,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
4879,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title

But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
4887,"
I love it

Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
4911,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
4912,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
4913,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!

"
4922,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
4923,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
4924,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
4925,"
Love it.
"
4926,"

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.
"
4933,"
Loved this tripod!!! It’s very sturdy
"

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"
4943,"

So far so good, comes with a phone mount as well. I’ll update anything changes
"
4945,"
Cute and sturdy
"
4946,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
4947,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
4948,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
4949,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
4950,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
4951,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
4952,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
4953,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
4954,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool

I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

4973,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.

"
4984,"
Excellent
"
4985,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
4986,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
4987,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
4988,"
Feels very durable!

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
5014,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
5015,"
I really like it
"
5016,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
5017,"
Wow
"
5018,"
Good
"
5019,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
5020,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
5021,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
5022,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
5023,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
5024,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
5025,"
Stiff
"
5026,"
It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
5034,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
5035,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
5036,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
5037,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
5038,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
5039,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
5040,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
5041,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
5042,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
5043,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
5044,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
5049,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
5050,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
5051,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
5052,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
5053,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
5054,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.

A must have for vlogs!
"
5064,"
It's sturdy and versatile. I use it for my sony camera and my phones.
"
5065,"
Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
5066,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
5067,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
5068,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
5069,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.
"

Got this to help with videos and pictures and I love it. You can place it anywhere and have it stay!

My daughter loves it!! She use it for her YouTube channel🤩

You can literally put this tripod anywhere
"
5074,"
It's worth recommending
"
5075,"
It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
5076,"
Es muy estable
"
5077,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.
"
5078,"
I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"
5079,"
Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
5080,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
5081,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
5082,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
5083,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
5084,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
5085,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
5086,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
5087,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.
"
5088,"
Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
5089,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
5090,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
5091,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
5092,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
5093,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
5094,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
5095,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
5096,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
5097,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
5098,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
5099,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.

Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
5103,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
5104,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
5105,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
5106,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.

Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.

Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"

I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
5112,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
5113,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
5191,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
5192,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
5193,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
5194,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
5195,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️
"

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
5213,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
5214,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
5215,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
5216,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.

I was looking for a mount so i could film without having somebody with me, works perfect on the stand and or if you want to mount it to an object.
"

Love this thing for my Sony zv10! Since the camera is on the smaller end, it makes me feel more secure holding it. Also gives me the distance I need for doing selfies since the camera crops a little with video.

We are daily youtube vloggers and we use our iPhones and gopros every day...I’ve tried and ruined many many many tripods (legs always break off) and was on the hunt for a more durable one...saw this on a lightning deal (the mini version) and bought it and a few others that broke of course...by FAR this is the best tripod we’ve ever used! I have now purchased FIVE Fotopro tripods! Lol one to keep on each car for the phones and one for each of our gopros. We are dumpster divers so we love that this is thick as a handheld monopod, strong with an excellent grip as a tripod, washable and nonporous, easy to use, doesn’t slip out of a pocket, and is much more stable than any other tripod we’ve tried! Just love it. Can not recommend these enough. (We have yet to try the remote because we don’t use one, but love it for the tripod!)
"
5245,"
I love that is small. It worked great with my Asia trip. It fitted my gopro camera and during the pandemic I used it for the phone in calls. I have also used it for my microphone in a theater and it works perfectly without moving from the attached place. I really recommend it!
"
5246,"
This little tripod is a life saver.  Stands at perfect level over my laptop so I can use my DSLR as a webcam for zoom meetings.  I like that the legs bend so I can wrap it around chairs, etc to make it work in a pinch.  Great that it works on both phone and my canon camera.  I deducted a star because I wish it had a way to keep the legs stable and move just the camera side to side to follow a moving object, and also the legs are stable for the most part but if they’re not perfectly positioned the weight of the camera can tip it over. My camera almost crashed to the hard ground while filming a seminar (thankfully I caught it, but the seminar was interrupted). Overall though I am very pleased with this product and would recommend.

I’m obsessed with this little tripod!!!! I was skeptical before buying… no one wants to put their $3000 equipment on a tripod that breaks!! But I’m soo pleased with how sturdy and strong this little guy is. I can use this tripod literally anywhere. My favorite tripod ever. Buy it.
"
5249,"
El tripode esta muy bonito, se nota que es el diseño original por la calidad del materia. No raya las superficies y es suave al tacto, para los niños esta muy bien ya que difícilmente se golpean al agarrarlo. Por su tamaño es muy versatil y cabe en cualquier lugar ... se puede usar muy bien en la cama o en la cocina a la hora de cocinar.Lo único negativo que tiene es que esta diseñado para colocar el celular en modo landscape o sea acostado si deseas colocarlo de foma vertical como es lo natural al momento de usar el teléfono, debes retorcer las patas para obtener esa posición... a fin de cuentas si se logra pero el tripode queda en una posición extraña ocupando mas espacio del normal ... es lo único que cambiaría quizás si agregaran una cabeza para colocarlo vertical sería mejor o yo no he descubierto como hacerlo.... Te lo recomiendo.
"
5250,"
Do not buy this. It is extremely cheap. The screws do not stay tight. It only holds your phone in landscape mode, not portrait mode. They try to sell you on this ""UFO"" design for the legs, which don't even move in all directions. This might be good for amateur or novice photographers, but will not sustain any long term camera use. There's no shot this thing holds to a fence post or railing and keeps your phone upright, let alone a DSLR camera. You couldn't pay me to use this.
"
5251,"
I use it ALL the time, what a great size to throw in your backpack for a hike, or in your purse for a day out. It’s so easy to set up, wraps around anything, and is easy to clean. I mostly just use it with my phone but it holds my big ol camera too! Definitely a great purchase, and so happy I don’t have to interject and ask people to take photos of us all the time (and you know I’m not giving my phone to a stranger in a pandemic!) 10/10 a great purchase.

Everything seems to be good quality. I am slightly worried about the folding action of the arms not holding up.Because you have to pull every hard to get the arms to bend (which is fine), there is a lot of torque put on the base of the arms. This would be fine if this base were fixed, and it was simply pulling against a static anchor into the frame, however; there is a hinge there allowing for normal folding tripod movement, which I also am unsure if it is needed, as you could just bend all 3 arms out a bit to get a normal tripod configuration. I am worried that because this is a hinge and not an anchor to the frame, that the force of pulling the legs to bend them - which is much greater than the force required to simply pull the legs away from the frame to form a normal tripod - will eventually weaken / break this hinge.
"
5263,"
I bought this a stand for my sony a5100 when I'm streaming but have also used while recording videos as sort of a handle. The flexible legs really let you decide how you want it to set up. Its easy to straighten out and hasn't lost any durability in the time I've had it. I almost wish the tripod legs were a little longer but overall a great product.
"
5264,"
I purchased this item to be used with my Sony alpha camera. It also came with a phone holder piece that I didn’t think I would use however it has came extremely handy on long flights for use of on flight entertainment (using phone for movies). This product is so versatile can me molded into a cup holder in a car for navigation or other handsfree uses. I recently used the tripod with my camera while at the Grand Canyon formed around a tree branch to take a family photo. Molds great around railings and other similar textures for handsfree photos. I highly recommend this tripod. Purchasing a second for my son who frequently borrows it for many uses ex: for watching videos during his bubble baths. The price is great and the material is durable. I love it and am sure i haven’t even used it to it’s full potential yet.
"
5265,"
Exactly what I was looking for. This will allow me to attach my gopro to almost anything.
"
5266,"
I purchased this a week a go , matrial is great and seems very good quality. Weight is good too, but and only now when I picked it up to use realizing that the attachment piece is not compatible with portrait mood in phone and frankly I am not seeing any way that it can be compatible with my cameras ( I have a DSLR and a digital ones ) and I am very disappointed with this specially that there is a whole other piece shown in photos and video, so it was I expected to receive. Now I can’t send it back because I am traveling out of country for couple of days, and will have to search and purchase an extra piece to do the Job.
"
5267,"
I use this tripod to film my YouTube videos. My videos are usually sit down, talk to the camera type videos so I either have this tripod sitting on a surface (like a counter or table) or I wrap the tripod legs around my ring light stand. I have also used it for vlogging and it is very lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold my sony camera. I love that the legs are flexible so it is never an issue finding a way to prop up the tripod to film.If you are interested check out my YouTube Channel, Tara Sapp. I use this tripod to film all of my videos.
"
5268,"
All in all, this is a great product but it has it's limitations. The tripod is sturdy and malleable but it's difficult to balance my camera at times because getting the legs 100% straight again is difficult. If you're ok with that, I recommend the buying this product, otherwise I would go for a traditional tripod where it will be easier to prop up and mount your camera on.
"
5269,"
It is an ok tripod But the big minus is that it doesn't have a swivel ball head so it is more difficult to adjust angles of shooting. There are other better options on the market. Don't buy this one. I recommend this one:-----3in1 Action Camera DSLR Phone Portable Flexible Mini Travel Tripod Camcorder Projector Tabletop Stand Mount for Canon iPhone Webcam Youtuber Reviewer---The one i recommend is much more versatile and just better. Thank me later. :)
"

I like this. It is good for my camera and flexible
"
5271,"
My review is for the UFO 2 Set. I love this tripod! It’s well made, portable and is very dynamic. It’s perfect for travel or when you don’t want to bring your big heavy tripod. You can use it with your point and shoot camera, your mobile phone, your action cam and it even holds DSLRS in a pinch! It held my D700 full frame DSLR. I dont expect to use it with my big camera all the time. I have a Manfrotto for that.I’ve tried a similar product that looks almost the same, but the UFO 2’s legs hold better and feel like they will last a long time. The legs also have a great feeling rubber grip to it and can be used as a gimbal/ grip for taking videos too. Love the adjustable head and that the feet are rubber with nothing to fall or break off like other brands. This is the mini flexible tripod to get.

Since I do a ton of news, social media, social videos, I want something that is versatile that can hold both phone & camera depending where I am working.This gadget does just that. I will ad photos later showing both.  If you are definitely in the media field you might want to ad this to your tool bag! If you love taking photos and want some to hold your firmly, this is it. If you can operate your phone remotely, this is great for table top interviews, desk interviews, and can hold your camera with ease!I stumbled across this when looking for something to hold my new cameras. Great buy!!!!

When I bought this I was skeptical but I gave it a try. I am not a fan of tripods even though we all know we need them one huge reason is I hate carrying huge things around I may not even need that day! This one being flexible I was like why not...so I received this and soon found out it is so easy to roll up the legs I can fit it in a lens pouch inside of my bag so I don’t have to carry a huge tripod around. Yes I know it won’t do the job for everything but if u need something that won’t take up space will stand and be sturdy and is versatile this will definitely help you out. The legs snap into place and stay.

I received this item in the mail today. I ordered it specifically to use with my Sony A6400. I want to be able to set up a tripod in very unique ways to capture footage of myself working and creating as I am a metalsmith and jewelry designer. This tripod is sturdy, unique, and accessible for anything you want to do with it. I highly recommend this!
"
5275,"
When it comes to handheld tri-pods, I'm very skeptical. I had one last year that was cheap plastic and snapped a month after I got it. This tri-pod however, is top notch. I can easily bend it to the way I need and the grip strength is an absolute beast. 10/10 would recommend.
"
5276,"
Looked into the gorilla pod to find that after general use the nots break. So I decided to look into this style. Very firm grip. Holds phone decently. Sturdy enough for my gimbal. Perfect for on the go. Have had it for a few months. Love this little guy. Perfect for vlogging. Makes playing Pokémon Go or watching YouTube while walking the dog and baby easier.
"
5277,"
I am a new vlogger and this tripod was perfect for carrying my camera around the city with me! It seems to be very sturdy and I wasn't worried about my camera dropping. It works with multiple cameras(mine is NikonB500) as long as you have the tripod hole at the bottom. I was also able to prop my camera up multiple places due to the rubber like material and flexible legs.I would highly recommend!
"
5278,"
I bought this when I was traveling to Hawaii. I have to tell you the quality is amazing. I originally wanted to buy the gorillapod. But I have to tell you that this is as good as the gorillapod.
"
5279,"
I love how I can wrap this around a tree branch or an old fence post while out and about.  It bends perfectly!  I've taken perfect selfies and group photos with this without having to find a flat surface.  I wish I had this years ago.
"
5280,"
Excellent flexible tripod. I use it daily for my videos. I have wrapped this thing around whatever you can imagine. I’ve owned it for a while now. Still works great. I switched from a super expensive Joby one with the knuckles to this and haven’t been disappointed. Highly recommend
"
5281,"
This tripod does not work for my needs at all. The clip to hold your phone has preset widths, so it’s not a tight fit on the phone. The swivel head that the mount sits on also does not spin enough to give you a full vertical set up. I missed the return window, so I guess it’s going to Goodwill.
"
5282,"
Light and easy to carry, quick to set up, and included remote makes it easy to use.  Have used it on one hike and it performed very well, held our phones securely (and one of those is one of the big ""phablet"" style phones), and allowed us to get pics we would not have been able to get without it.We found that the remote needs to be ""woken up"" to reconnect w/the phone when there is some time between pictures (e.g., picture in spot A, hike some more, picture in spot B). It did reconnect reliably.The legs are easy to bend but firm enough to hold position securely, and the tripod has enough adjustments that it's easy to get the picture level and oriented the way you want.  Recommended.
"
5283,"
Recently took it on a trip to the Grand Canyon and I really like this product. The arms hold on tightly and it’s easy to get it back straight
"
5284,"
Okay here is a comprehensive look at this tripod. Note that it is all plastic and flexible foam rubber so it’s not for heavy cameras. If you just want a tripod to take pictures with your smartphone or action camera this is a really good option. I would have given it 5 stars all the way but the provided head that holds the phone is very weak. If you are not careful it will break when you torque the tension screw down to secure the phone. The legs are very flexible and feel sturdy. I actually like them more than my gorilla pod just because they are more flexible and the foam rubber will grab on to surfaces better.
"
5285,"
So far so good, it's a good size, it is very flexible and easy to work with... I really don't have any dislikes about this. It's great for its size and limitations of use as compared to a normal standard height tripod...
"
5286,"
Me encanto ligero, flexible y igual a la foto 10/10
"
5287,"
This flexible tripod is very useful! It came just in time to film my short film, and everything turned out great. I wish the legs of the tripod were a bit tougher, but for everyday use, the tripod works just fine. One of the better types of flexible tripods on the market!
"
5288,"
My phone is pretty big with it's case on. The dimensions for the phone holder are spont on and holds my big ass phone with it's metal case perfectly. Highly recommend for zoom meetings or streaming on the go from your phone.
"
5289,"
I bought this for my dslr, but my husband loves it so much, he uses it to hold his cellphone all the time. He likes it because he can angle it any which way he wants.
"
5290,"
We were looking for a product to use with our Iphone X, specifically for face time, this Flexible tripod fit the need perfectly, we also looked at some others and chose this one from Fotopro because it looked to be more durable.The legs are very flexible but also rubber coated vs the foam covering we saw on others which makes me feel this will last a long time. The 90 degree movement of the attachment point is great because you can use the phone in both landscape as well as portrait mode.The ability to attach this tripod to practically anything with the flexible legs.
"
5291,"
Not as small as I would have liked but awesome just the same, it holds my Nikon Coolpix B-700 without any issues, last tri-pod would tip over from the weight of my compact camera, so flexible and wraps around virtually anything. Very sturdy, well built, Very pleased with my purchase.
"
5292,"
Fantastic customer service from Carol at Fotopro! I actually ordered the wrong product - I meant to order the tripod that came with the adapter for GoPro's but ordered the basic model instead (phone adapter only). Fotopro sent me a new one with the correct adapter at no extra charge.I did use the tripod on a recent work trip and it works very well. I used it with iPhone and GoPro and it was easy to use for both. The legs are easily adjusted and stay in place. Seems like it will be highly durable; I've already used it multiple times in salt water.
"
5293,"
It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The grip isn't for every type of surface but for it to stand up and latch on to things are perfectly fine it's really good and just easy to use. Would definitely recommend. However I dont know what to do with the red wheel I thought it was supposed to move but it doesnt. Also the legs are very bendable like you could legit move them in any type of way and put them back together and they'd be fine.
"
5294,"
It's nice that it has adjustable nobs and legs but what about if I needed to shift it up or down a bit now see thats my problem .. It doesn't and it make it hard to do anything.
"
5295,"
This little tripod is great for my needs! It’s about the right size for making YouTube videos and actually works really well as a selfie stick too. I love that the legs are waterproof and bendable, I haven’t tried the extreme posing functions yet but it appears the tripod will hold up to a lot and will be very versatile. I wish it was a tiny bit taller, maybe 2-3 inches, but that’s my only complaint!
"
5296,"
This is a decent product. Well made and it works as its supposed to. This one has a metal screw to attach to camera. That's good. I had one that was plastic that lasted one day,threw it out. This mini pod is ok and is versatile.
"
5297,"
This is the perfect handheld, portable tripod for an Iphone! It can stand on its own and can be adjusted to just about any shape or wrap around any object to hold it up.The only thing is it won’t hold your phone straight up and down, you can only use it horizontally.
"
5298,"
Perfect for cameras
"
5299,"
I like how I can put my Canon Rebel T6 on here and it won't fall off. I haven't tried putting it upside down. The phone holder is a bit weird but it holds very well. I like how I can bend the tripod legs anyway u want. A bit top heavy when u have a camera on it.
"
5300,"
I really debated back and forth on quite a few different handheld tripods.I needed something for my desk top and daily needs. i decided to go against the trend and bought this brand....I have to say i really like it for everything I do. I  would keep this in mind for gifting my camera buds!
"
5301,"
Works great! Prefer it to the Gorilla Pod design since it doesn't have ball joints that could pop out. The hinges where the legs fold out can be a bit loose but it's usually no problem. I've used this many times to take pictures of myself or groups using my cell phone as a remote and it works really well! Also have used is several times for my speedlite to just quickly set at a low angle for a shot.
"
5302,"
Works great to hold my dslr and rode videomic, only issue is the thread seems to screw past what it should. So even though it’s tight it “could” be tighter, which makes it feel like it could break if it was too tight. It’s a solid unit and holds lots of weight. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Joby line and this seems to be it.
"
5303,"
This tripod is very sturdy. It will easily be able to hold a DSLR without bending. Quite comfortable to hold in a hand if your planning to vlog. I recommend this product to anyone needing a reliable and sturdy tripod.
"
5304,"
One of the legs broke because it was made with soft mental core at the joint.  I don't recommend this product.
"
5305,"
The Bad: The red plastic part and the handle do feel a little cheap and at times brittle, but even with repeated heavy use everything seems fine. The grippy legs are actually a pain in the butt to pull out of a backpack so I've started putting it in a mesh bag so I can put it away easier.The Good: Everything else! This is a really great portable option with tons of versatility. Both heads work great and at a great price point.
"
5306,"
For a tripod that doesn't move up and down like a traditional one it doesn't get better than this
"
5307,"
I once used Fotopro UFO2 but I did not like the ball head because it sometimes did not sustain mid-weight mirrorless cameras (gx85). Now I really like this basic tripod without the ball head rather than the  UFO2. By mounting another sturdy mini ball head (Harwerrel Tripod Mini Ball Head: about $12), this tripod becomes a perfect flexible tripod I ever used!!!! Much versatile and sturdier than Gorilla pod 3k which costs $20 more than the combination I made!!!
"
5308,"
I wanted to do an update review on this product because unfortunately it broke while I was recording. I emailed the company, and they're already sending me a brand new one to replace the broken one (5 days after initial email). Overall, this tripod is everything I wanted and incredibly durable overall. I'm incredibly satisfied with both the customer service as well as the tripod.
"
5309,"
Great for holding up my canon camera and highly recommend this for anyone looking for a tripod. It’s beyond what it’s worth, it’s a lot better than these other tripods you can get at Best Buy which are way over priced. It’s great for recording my car videos
"
5310,"
Was great for the 2 days I got to use it before my puppy got a hold of it and chewed one of the feet off. I'll pick it up again when I have more money, but would recommend to anyone looking for a good mini tripod right now.
"
5311,"
Like others, I own other competitor styles and this one just fits my needs much better. I really wanted one that was easy to hold with my Sony A7III attached. This fits the bill perfectly. Also, I am never concerned that the camera is at risk of falling off.
"
5312,"
I have 3 other tripods, However I wanted a flexible model. Not sure how much I would use so I got this well priced, Amazon recommended model. It performs everything that it is supposed to do well. If you intend to use one a lot, I would recommend getting a model with a better smartphone mount and rotating ball on the mount, for more flexibility. But if you need a good basic flexible tripod, this can not be beat for the price.
"
5313,"
I use this to shoot with my iPhone pretty consistently, but when trying to use it for even a point and shoot camera, the legs don't hold up well. Perfect for iPhone, but something sturdier for a small camera is best.
"
5314,"
We use the stand to hang the baby camera from the mirror edge in our bedroom.With the standard screw mount, our baby monitor camera attaches and becomes versatile. Wherever we go, a basic hook or ledge becomes a place to stand, hang, or hug this tri-pod and point the baby monitor at our little one.
"
5315,"
I was skeptical but the tripod is stable and has been a great tool for video with no shake in the video from holding it.
"
5316,"
Oh my goodness. I had thought this was too good to be true. My husband purchased this for me for V-Day. I had no clue but I knew when I opened the box. My Nikon D7100 fit on it without issue and does indeed hold it up without problem. It also came with a small attachment for phones, this is also great and wonderful - super easy to use and sturdy! Great present! <3
"
5317,"
This was a second time because I lost my last phone clip. This time around it came with the phone clip but didn’t have the pivot on it so I could use it in multiple ways. I plan on purchasing another. Before I do I want to hear from the company or supplier on why the change up on the phone clip.
"
5318,"
I received it today and absolutely love it the quality is great it feels high end!!! I highly recommend this product it’s so easy to use making it enjoyable!!! I will definitely be buying another one soon for back up :)
"
5319,"
Fantastic tripod, especially for traveling. I have a Sony camera that is a bit heavy, even this tripod can support it. I've had it for over a year and travel with it to many countries. Zero problems and easily fits into carryon luggage.
"
5320,"
I've been using this for about a month now to set up my camera on my desk while recording and as a handheld monopod while walking. The grip is comfortable; although, it can take some getting used to when the tripod is flexed at a curve.Otherwise, 5/5!
"
5321,"
Put my Canon EOS R on it along with my 100mm f 2.8 lens. It's rated at 1200 grams, but the combination of this camera and lens was pushing 1400. Still held up just fine. Will be taking this to Italy in a couple of weeks. Paired it with a tiny ball head. Even with the added weight of the ball head, camera and lens, it was stable.
"
5322,"
like the size and the fact you can attach it just about anywhere. Only as steady as what you have attached it to, when attached to the bleachers tended to shake a little and noticeable on the recordings
"
5323,"
This tripod is so easy to use, and handy for my phone. I could just put it on the table, and move it to any directions I want.
"
5324,"
Over all pretty good. The knob that holds it still sometimes loosens. But alot better than what I had.
"
5325,"
The best part of the some many great things about this tripod is the grip on the legs. It is pleasing to hold in you hand with the camera attached. The screw attachment is tight and the legs are strong. I am using it with a Sony A6000 and the kit lens and it is very sturdy. Can't wait to wrap it around to get those hard to get shots.
"
5326,"
I like that it wraps around things and is sturdy enough to use as a stick.  I wish it was about 4-6"" longer but bet it couldn't with the elasticity of the legs.  Still, looking forward to using it.
"
5327,"
Tripod works as described, easy to use.
"
5328,"
I use this every day as a handle for my dslr. It’s my go to piece of gear I do not leave home with out. And it makes a great tripod
"
5329,"
Great price and works awesome. Amazing substitute for the expensive stuff. Also very durable. U can’t beat this for the price
"
5330,"
I use this to hold my camcorder for my attempts to vlog. Its versatile because it's you can attach your phone or a camera/camcorder. And if you want you can unscrew the phone attachment and screw it onto a larger tripod 😁
"
5331,"
Works great as a multi-device. Tripod, selfie stick, camera stand. Very light and easy to carry. Wraps around items for picture taking when there are no flat surfaces. Legs are bendable to use on uneven surfaces. Works with cell phone, GoPro or my large camera.
"
5332,"
I haven't FULLY experienced it yet (due to lockdown) but it came delivered just fine, and is much sturdier than the tripod I had last year. It's extremely flexible and comes with a phone clamp!
"
5333,"
I like the flexibility for different camera angles.
"
5334,"
Wish the legs were more easily put into position but they can never be the same way more than once. Other than that, good product.
"
5335,"
So good I had to buy a second.  Holds my outdoor cams 100% secure.Beautifully designed and crafted.Thanks!
"
5336,"
Super easy to use for both my camera and my phone. I like that it is small and light enough to carry around. Highly recommend!
"
5337,"
I just received this mini tripod and have really enjoyed it. It has an adapter for your cell phone as well as works for dslrs and mirror less cams. You can attach to limbs of trees, hand railings, use as regular tripod, on elevated surfaces and so on, use your imagination and go take some pictures. Love this product and bought because of a YouTube recommendation.
"
5338,"
The camera mount is cheap plastic that is not wide enough to hold any phone in a case. Why do these designers continue to make these ridiculous narrow camera holder’s that cannot hold any iPhone that has a case around it? 99% of people have cases on their phones yet they keep making camera mounts as if no one uses a case! And if you have a sturdy protective case that has any unusual shape or angles to it, this flimsy camera mount with skinny rubber grips is completely incapable of holding it on the tripod.
"
5339,"
Loving it thus far.  I purchased two.  One fir me and other for my grandson.
"
5340,"
I just opened the tripod and a pice of plastic fallen down was broken and I spected a remote and also it doesn’t have it, the product quality is really nice very flexible is light and the holder to your phone is awesome. How ever I’m disappointed bout the moment I opened and was brokenIf you are beggening with cameras and photos think about the small size because I have the medium and is really big, the small one is a perfect option. Portable and you can go everywhere with it!
"
5341,"
Great product!
"
5342,"
Not bad at all. The product works as described. It fits my little Zonko action camera as well as my iPhone. My phone case is a little tight for the mount, but, overall, I can wiggle it in there. If you are going to wrap it around stuff, it works great. Not bad for a selfie stick in a pinch either.
"
5343,"
I love this tripod. It works very good. Enough though I’ve had for about 3 to 4 months......it’s really good. Even under water and in the ocean. Plus it work very good in the heat and the humanity.
"
5344,"
I took this on vacation and it was the perfect size for traveling, I can fit it in my purse. The flexibility of the tripod allowed me to take photos and videos at almost any angle. It is durable and made of quality material. It also comes with a phone clip which is very convenient. I love it!
"
5345,"
It does what it says it will do and does it well
"
5346,"
This was easy to set up and use and the additional bracket for a phone camera was a bonus. We got some great pictures of the Northern Lights from a rolling ship.
"
5347,"
I have mounted my nikon d5600 on it and it wordks great, I would not use it outdoor in windy conditions though. I think its excellent as a phone accesory and for a dsrl too, but with caution for the latter.
"
5348,"
Love the design and the capabilities.  Fotopro Tripod is going to be my companion during my working hours even though I will not be taking videos or photos.  If you continue to misplace your phone, worry no more.  I can see my phone from far away so it does not get lost anymore.  Love this device.
"
5349,"
Bought this for my daughter who is into photography. She loved it. it is so versatile and can be taken anywhere and wrapped around anything and also can be used as a tripod stand. Perfect gift!!!!!!!
"
5350,"
Perfect for blogging, selfies, etc. I’ve used it for sooo many different things. The bendy legs are like octopus legs and can hang only anything! Then, if you need it to be a tripod it works great too!It also folds up and fits in my bag well!
"
5351,"
I just love this product. Still using. Light and Grip is good. Material used is good.
"
5352,"
I like to build 3D puzzles and then record the finished product on my smartphone. This tripod allows me to free up both my hands as I show off my model build. It’s perfect. Very light easy to use and very portable.
"
5353,"
I like the sturdiness of the item and the fact that we can place it to record our YouTube videos in the perfect spot without it falling. We use it to record our YouTube videos.
"
5354,"
Good
"
5355,"
Bends very easy.  Rubber grip on the legs is very nice.  Phone holder attachment is a plus as well.
"
5356,"
I loved how you can use it for almost anything. The tripod is very flexible, so you can shape it for any angles you need when it comes to recording videos.
"
5357,"
Versatility
"
5358,"
Im using this product to hold my camera while I record for my youtube video, and this tripod is one of the best!
"
5359,"
Exactly what I needed. So much better than my old one.  Easy to use and not too heavy.  Love it.  Would totally recommend it.
"
5360,"
Haven't tried using the remote yet.  Stand is working g great! Wish it had a better swivel feature on the head. I think the more expensive version does.
"
5361,"
It's a decent tripod. nothing special
"
5362,"
I really love this tripod, I love that the legs of it are so adjustable and its easy to do so! This is a great quality product and I use it all the time!
"
5363,"
Oh my gosh! This is a must! Best 18$ I’ve spent on a camera equipment. I love how small it is where you can bring with you anywhere you go. I love how the handles have grip to mount on to any surface. I simply love it!! I will be using this almost everyday.
"
5364,"
Its versatile features enable you to attain a stable platform in almost any situation. It has a strong secure grip on almost any surface and still works well as a standard tripod. It is a bit on the heavy side.
"
5365,"
Works great.  Exactly as described.  Have had it for a few months.  Took it to Europe and used it with a gopro and Canon M50.  Worked great with both.  Highly recommend.
"
5366,"
perfect size lightweight use your rear camera or your cell phone it works wonders and it definitely comes in handy get yourself one you won't be disappointed
"
5367,"
Great for unique situations like wrapping legs around a post or a ladder.
"
5368,"
I love this! I tested it last week with my phone and it was so easy to use! I can't wait to try my new camera on it once that comes in. Would definitely recommend to any Youtuber, Vlogger, or Influencer!
"
5369,"
I have had this for a little over a week but I can see that it should do all that I expect. I had another similar tripod for a couple of years, but chose to get this one because it is a little less bulky.
"
5370,"
U absolutely love this tripod OMG I was looking for the perfect one to hold up my new canon EOS M100 and this was beyond my expectations very happy with purchase 😊☺️✨

Purchased for grandson in college. He loved it!

Easy to use
"

Very steady and strong tripod. It work prefect with everything. My phone my action camara and my Canon M50.
"
5376,"
Excellent tripod.  Light weight and very stable.  Tried it a couple of times and I think this little tripod will last for a long time. I have iPhone 6 Plus with a heavy duty case, it can fit into this tripod without any problem.
"
5377,"
Very functional tripod, I bought it to be my secondary tripod for my last trip and I barely had to use my main tripod because this was so easy and quick to adjust. I could place it on uneven surfaces and it was holding my Canon 80D with 18-135 lens quite well.
"
5378,"
Great product
"
5379,"
Easy to use for small camera
"
5380,"
Very light weight and durable. It really worth it! I have had like 3 different ones and none compare to how good this one turned out.
"
5381,"
Have an old sony a7, work great with it. Love the legs, instead of those bumpy legs that other similar tripods have and it's super sturdy for those wrap arounds. However, tried twisting the legs together like in the pic, ended up breaking a piece off.
"
5382,"
This tripod is wonderful. It is sturdy and made of quality products. It works for vlogging.
"
5383,"
This is a pretty light, compact, and versatile little tripod. It works well, feels and is stable and can be wrapped around objects to make a stand. This can be used with both a smart phone or a DSLR camera.
"
5384,"
It's very nice but mine never came with a phone mount. I don't dona whole lot of stuff with my phone but it would've been nice if it came with it.
"
5385,"
Sturdy and holds even my heaviest of cameras. It can bend into whatever shape you need and can take a beating
"
5386,"
SUPER FLEXIBLE AND STURDY! LOVE THE BLACK AND RED COLOR AND DESIGN. ATTACHES NEARLY ANYWHERE !
"
5387,"
I got this to be able to wrap around cruise railings to capture footage.  Just got back from the cruise and loved using this while filming on the cruise.  Worked really really well!
"
5388,"
Finally able to hang my camera above my shower pointing to the rest of the room. I no longer get pranked.
"
5389,"
Just what I was looking for!
"
5390,"
I’m be only used for a few months, but I am very happy!  Will wrap around anything it can fit on and holds very well. Time will tell how long it lasts, but I have been overly pleased so far.
"
5391,"
Fantastic product, just a note to others who want to put heavy camera+lens on this, my Nikon D750 + Nikkor 16-35f4 is the most it can take.
"
5392,"
the tripod is functional as well as versatile.
"
5393,"
Very compact, feels sturdy. Easy to use but it has a good grip.I've used it on some questionable terrain and it managed to stay put.
"
5394,"
Has a nice grip on phone, used standing on table, hanging from shelf and in hand. Worked well in all cases. Also has standard camera mount.
"
5395,"
Most of the time when I’m out shooting a take a folding tripod but ever since I bought this I’ve been leaving my larger tripods at home. I shoot with a canon 77d and it’s plenty of support
"
5396,"
You’d think I’d dropped it but no, I didn’t even have it propped up on something hard. Took it out of the Amazon bag in gymnastic mats and proceeded to move the legs into a J position in order to shoot my form on a stretch and this plastic piece on the leg joint immediately snapped off. What a piece of crap! I didn’t even try to make the legs go into a U just a J shape and the thing snapped right at the joint. Sure it still works but I certainly don’t trust this tripod will hold together very long if pieces break off right out of the box.Otherwise it seems versatile enough and the legs are very flexible.
"
5397,"
I loved my first so much, I ordered a second one. I added a Joby ball head to the UFO legs and now I have the perfect mini tripod for smaller cameras.

I don't expect this to last with heavy use, especially if I'm not careful with the legs. The legs may survive but the base plastic will most definitely break quickly. I would still recommend it for the price however and would caution against roughing it.
"

Item received promptly and it worked for what i needed it for. Thank You.
"

Boy am I glad I didnt use a fortune on a Gorillapod, this thing is awesome and sturdier than anything much more expensive, I love it and I plan on getting the other models in the series.
"
5401,"
It's really strong can't wait use my camera
"
5402,"
Works great with iPhone nice a firm!!
"

Bought this for a mirrorless camera for travel. Something small I could pack in my bag. This isn't meant to replace those big tripods, but this is versatile. The legs bend and grip so they can be wrapped around a pole, or on an incline, or something high or low. The problem, which is serious, is that my mirrorless camera shakes on it. Even with a remote shutter you see a small shake and I have it tightened as much as I date. It’s mostly plastic.  Don’t but this if you plan to use it for anything larger than a phone. Flexibility in design unfortunately equals flexibility in the mount and shaky pics.

Get's the job done exactly as it should
"
5405,"
We use this to make vlogs. It’s lightweight and easy to setup. Love it
"
5406,"
I LOVE this tripod so much I bought two! Super cool how they have an extension for your phone, I use mine with my Sony a6300 and it keeps it steady and supported!
"
5407,"
Best handheld tripod I’ve had so far! Works like a charm, the legs can bend so it can sit at any angle you’d like. Also very stable for my g7x mark 2
"
5408,"
Nice flexible tripod. Bought this for use on a vacation. Fit in my carry on nicely, and worked well at different locations for longer exposures. It wrapped around objects and held on well.
"
5409,"
Great purchase for my GoPro. I can put this on anything that has a limb or ledge and twist my camera whichever way I need to. It stays put and is solidly built.
"
5410,"
I love everything about it and the price is excellent
"
5411,"
I purchased this tripod based off a recommendation to take videos using my iPhone. So far it has been great and perfect for what I needed.
"
5412,"
Quality seems great but didn’t come with the attachments pictured to hold a phone vertically and customer service didn’t respond at all.
"
5413,"
This tripod worked great for what I needed, however one of the legs broke internally after a short time rendering it useless.  It is a great design, just not very sturdy for repeated use.
"
5414,"
Very cool device. It grips better than a GorrilaPod and is nice and light. The build quality is very nice. It’s all plastic but it feels like sturdy, quality plastics. I recommend it!
"
5415,"
Perfect for vlogging which is what i needed it for wish it was more compact but that’s okay.
"
5416,"
It is so versatile and flexible but sturdy and durable. Great product!
"
5417,"
it would be better if the clamp extends more
"
5418,"
I like the grip, easy to use. Great for extended handling and videos
"
5419,"
This is a  awesome camera mount exceeds my expectations.I use it to hold a Fx  radar chronograph  and it works flawlessly .
"
5420,"
Easy to used , small an portable.  It's perfect for my Canon M50.
"
5421,"
Use it with my Canon 5D MarkIII and even with some larger zoom lenses, it is able to hold the load. Great for the price especially!
"
5422,"
This tripod is awesome and so more comfortable than a gorilla pod, Perfect size for your backpack side pocket and great performance, I am so happy with this. 100% good
"
5423,"
This one is good, but the one with the 360-degree swivel neck is much, much better. Get this one, you'll be much happier you did (I own both):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GW4ZWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title

Seems very strong it holds my Nikon d3400 with out any problems. The tripod holds its shape very well and the legs click in to place so it feels very stable
"
5428,"
The best !!!!!
"
5429,"
at first i was like.. oh no..this thing won't work.. but i was proven wrong.  so happy with this purchase
"
5430,"
But it just feels so cheap that something is bound to break. I wouldn't trust it with my high value camera but perfect for a point and shoot camera.
"
5431,"
I love it
"
5432,"
I love this product and use it almost daily for vlogging. It’s able to be attached to chairs, carts, held by hand, or stand on its own.
"
5433,"
Great product. Just what I needed.
"
5434,"
Such good quality, holds my camera anywhere! I wish it was a bit bigger, but still amazing

5437,"
I like this for selfie stick and tripod use. Fits my phone
"
5438,"
Love this for our Gopro Hero 7! It is so much more sturdy than the other options in this style. Definitely recommend it!
"

Works very well and is hardy.  Can take abuse.  It replace a different make that broke and this one is solidly made.
"

Better that what I expected. And a great buy for the price.
"
5444,"
This has changed my vlogging game man. I love that it has an amazing attachment for your phone as well.
"
5445,"
easily adjustable, mount just about anywhere.Solid bending legs are better than the pop-beads type tripod.Comes with small efficient smartphone clamp.Like it a lot!
"
5446,"
Gave as a gift for my lil bro, he loved it!!
"
5447,"
Only good for small cameras like go pro is not good for DSLR camera they are to heavy

5454,"
Love it! Works great even with a heavier camera.
"
5455,"
Great tripod, flexible. Grips things well.
"
5456,"
OK, so to begin with, I did like this tripod, it is flexible and easy to set up, although I was disappointed that you can't swivel the top where you put your phone in. But anyway, the phone connector snapped up with very little pressure, I now can't use it...Having looked since, the plastic at the top is very cheap, I wouldn't recommend.
"
5457,"
The experience thus far in using this most efficient tool- how the heck did I previously get by without it?!

Amazing it's just works. It's a great stabilizer and works with camera apps that take low light photos for me.
"
5466,"
The tripod is very strong and easy to use.It fits my camera and cell phone.
"
5467,"
I bought this thing a little over a month ago, I was being cheap not trying to buy a gorillapod because of the price, I was using it for my camera, mind you my cameras not heavy, one of the legs ended up breaking on me today while shooting, it was mostly kept in my gear bag I wasn’t abusing it or anything, I feel like it would’ve lasted longer had I used it specifically for my phone... possibly
"
5468,"
Very flexible, grippy, holds its position.
"
5469,"
Love it.
"
5470,"

Unfortunately this item broke within a week day of having it, we wanted it for our son to make home videos with on an old phone but the phone attachment was easily cracked when our youngest hit it on something.

This does exactly what a tri-pod with flexible legs should do.
"

"
5489,"
Cute and sturdy
"
5490,"
I used this on my trip to Tokyo. Smarthest gadget I could’ve taken there.
"
5491,"
I used my M50 camera which is a pretty light weight camera. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks and one leg already broke. But overall I loved how light weight it was and easy to carry around.
"
5492,"
The tripod itself has a good grip however the holding mount for The phone was terrible lasted me for a couple hours then broke
"
5493,"
finally i found a great tripod that works very well and i can use for travel
"
5494,"
We love it. Fits our camera and was made with good quality.
"
5495,"
Just used it brand new for 30min. And I’m already satisfied for what it is at this price point. Definitely and help for tool for amateur to progressing film and picture taking stuff. Will update in 3months!. (UPDATE), I’m actually disappointed with how fast my tripod broke down, after 4 weeks, I noticed a significant weak joint that move your device forward/backwards. It has become practically useless🙁
"
5496,"
Found this to be a pretty useful tool until it broke at the leg. Yes joby gorillapods can eventually loosen up but this one snapped entirely.
"
5497,"
Works pretty much as a flexible tripod should. No problems or complaints considering price.
"
5498,"
Wish it was I bit longer but great tool
"

I don’t have any problems with that. Like it a lot

5517,"
This little tripod was amazing at first. I used it to take photos at my pole fitness business, as it can wrap around a pole easily!However, just a few months later, 2 of the 3 legs are now hanging limp, despite nothing detrimental ever happening to it, and the entire device is useless. It can not support itself with 1 leg. I tried to fix it and you cannot without ruining the device entirely so I didn't. I read there was a warranty, but contacting both the company and Amazon has lead nowhere so far. I get no reply.

 I was excited about this holder but disappointed to see this strange toxic looking powder that comes off the rubber everytime you touch it. See the video. I even tried cleaning this down thoroughly with a wet wipe but after it dried the same residue appeared again. There is a disturbing quality control issue going on here in China with this product.

"
5529,"
This is a really solid product. Does the job perfectly.
"
5530,"
Bought this item for use specifically during a family vacation.  One of the legs snapped on day 5, making it no longer bendable and essentially rendering this device useless.  I may have bent it a total of 10 times to take various pictures requiring the use of this tripod prior to it breaking.  Obviously, the quality of this device leaves a lot to be desired.  Also, $20 to take 10 pictures isn't what I would consider a great value for the money.  Look elsewhere.
"
5531,"
I bought this because I thought it was 17.9 inches in length, as advertised in the product description. It's not, it's 10.5 inches in length at best. When you add the attachment piece on top, add another inch. See pics.
"
5532,"
Feels very durable!

I never leave reviews but this is wild.  I got a used and broken item.  Clearly opened box.  No quality control.  This looks like a kid put it together.
"
5558,"
Very useful, met expectations.
"
5559,"
I really like it
"
5560,"
I purchased this item because, as pictured on Amazon, it clips to a phone from the bottom.However, as the image attached shows, I was sent an item that clips over the phone.This tripod is more expensive than others, it does not come with a remote, and does not match what was being sold.
"
5561,"
Wow
"
5562,"
Good
"
5563,"
I must say the product is sturdy and the handle is just want I needed ...BUT the attachment is not what is shown in the picture! NOT GOOD<<<NOT GOOD! Why would you show a product and is it not what is shown! Dahhhhh . Not happy!
"
5564,"
I used this product a couple dozen times over the course of the last 4 months and one of the legs broke today making it non functional as a tripod. It was pretty good while it lasted but broke way too soon and for no logical reason.
"
5565,"
I received this item and when I pulled out from box and bag, a piece of the tripod was already broken. I have never used it and didn't get to return. I travel so much that it's now I'm writing a review and it's too late to return. Not the best quality.
"
5566,"
I had this tripod for 25 days and one of the bendy legs broke.  It is meant to be flexible but after bending too many times it just snapped.  25 days later, I am ordering another tripod.
"
5567,"
This product is crap. Very flimsy and the legs do not lock in place causing the tripod feature to defeat the purpose. The 1st time They delivered the product, the package was empty! Stay away
"
5568,"
This is a piece of junk.  The collar that joins the legs broke the second time I used it.
"
5569,"
Stiff

It was standing and it feel and it just broke I was like wtf don’t buy please

using it for my GoPro hero 9 best versatile tripod works for every setting from hanging on tree branches, on a rail for a boat it holds on pretty well
"
5578,"
My son bought this and he says it is ""way better than Gorilla Pod. The legs won't pop off at the joints. The phone holder is really nice.""He definitely likes it.
"
5579,"
This has been a great little tripod and very versatile. I use it with my iPhone, but also to hold LED lights when I am doing video conferencing. I like it and have recommended it to others.
"
5580,"
This works great with the attachment included for my phone and work great with my Camcorder
"
5581,"
I received this product fast and in perfect shape. Great little tripod. I created my first YouTube video with this tripod. It fits both smartphone and camera which is what I was looking for.
"
5582,"
Decent quality for the price. We only use it for our phones, so haven't seen how well it works with a full sized heavy camera. We like that it fits both our phones that are a bit larger with cases on them. (Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy 8 Edge). The clamp for the phone is not springloaded, but manually adjusted, so just make sure you phone is SECURELY CLAMPED before you prop your tripod.  (It has loosened with more use and is not as strongly clamped, but we only use it at home anyways.)  And the clamp can be screwed on two ways as shown in the picture.  The rubber grips are very fleible and grab on to odd hanging positions quite well.
"
5583,"
This is literally the best camera tripod i have ever bought I recently bought this for the GoPro Hero 5 and let me just tell this tripod works perfectly for vlogging, it’s so flexible you can mount it practically anywhere, and it’s so durable and water proof this product is amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
"
5584,"
I absolutely love this tripod, I had one years ago and my dog chewed it up, but this one is much better made. I have been able to get some great photos with the flexability of this tripod. Would recommend to anyone.
"
5585,"
I was excited about this but it broke after of weeks of indoor use.
"
5586,"
I bought this to hold a small speaker. After 3 uses once leg broke off. I kept using as 2 let’s still function when gripping around something. After 2 more uses the 2nd leg broke and now this is no longer usable. Very cheaply made at the joint as it is all then plastic construction. I’m sure it’s fine if you just want a small tripod but if you plan on bending the legs around things to hold a camera or speaker this is not a good unit for you.
"
5587,"
I love this little tripod. I've used it several times, primarily for long exposure photography. It is easy to manipulate the bendy legs, and it is reliably steady when used on my mirrorless with wide angle lens. When shooting, I recommend a short shutter delay to avoid shake.My favorite feature is the light weight construction. I attach the camera, swing my strap behind my right arm and set out. The slight extra weight is unnoticeable, and I leave it on even when shooting hand held.But you can easily slip one leg in a pocket or strap to a small bag with ease.Always verify weight limitations when buying a tripod being sure to choose one with specs exceeding the weight of your camera and heaviest lens combination.I recommend this product for mirrorless cameras or cell phones.
"
5588,"
Im a small youtuber and I was looking to have something to carry my camera around to vlog with. This product is working out great for me. I feel it will last a long time. I love it.

 There’s a great grip, the sturdiness makes it easy to hold and control everything without worrying. It’s super easy to Bend and move the legs around. This product is such high quality for its price. Instead of buying a jobi I’d recommend this 10/10
"
5593,"
I like this for taking shot with my phone that I want to be a part of. Set up the shot, trip the timer, and get in front of the camera. Quite stable and easy to use.
"
5594,"
I'm pickey when it comes to camera gear. This thing is perfect for my phone, GoPro and Sony a6000. Feels like a cable, perfect blend of weight and sturdyness. I use it also to film kids at the skatepark. Its a great piece of equipment to have.
"
5595,"
I like this tripod for its versatility. Will use often.
"
5596,"
This is great for vlogging! It is really sturdy and you can bend it anyway you want
"
5597,"
Very pleased with the quality of this. The top hinge of the legs snaps in and out, and the legs are very bendable. feels like beefy construction that won't wear out any time soon. I'm also not worried about using this outside and getting the material scratched or dirty, since it isn't delicate. Very good value for the money.
"
5598,"
Bought this as a gift for my nephew who is a videographer.  He's rather rough and abusive on his equipment.  It has lasted over 2 years now. So, it's nephew approved.

Works really great! I was surprised to see how well it could hold up my DSLR camera, works well as a tripod too or handheld. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"
5610,"
Purchased this item for vlogging! It’s very easy to use! I love the versatility and sturdiness. Can’t wait to start my vlogs
"
5611,"
Noticed right away that last year’s model I bought is a pinch taller. That said, this design is so much more reliable and sturdy than joby, for the legs. These legs can be bent a million times and retain 100% of their dexterity, whereas Joby units’ integrity are entirely dependent on all those plastic ball joints. I ordered this 2nd one for my phone so I can leave my GoPro on the old one 24/7.
"
5612,"
Got this for my son when he goes snowboarding. He loves it!
"
5613,"
This tripod is amazing, lightweight and stable, the legs are strong.

It works good with my mini projector.  Its sturdy and can be molded to hook to anything.  It also has a c clamp mount for cellphones which is awesome.
"
5620,"
Es muy estable
"
5621,"
The best tripod is the one you always carry with you, and on that principle I think these may be the best travel tripods. They are not full height by any means, but they weight close to nothing and can fit in any bag. They also grab on to any rail, branches, poles that I can find in the vicinity. This fotopro holds up my mirrorless (EM1) with zoom lens no problem, all I had to do was to get a better tripod head and I have a versatile travel tripod that's good for long exposure or selfies when I travel.

I love this product! It is so versatile and perfect for adjusting and getting a level platform for my phone. I hike and fish a lot and it is always hard to find a level spot on the ground. This product has completely solved that issue. It's also great because it can grasp onto things like railings and tree branches, so finding the right angle is a lot easier. Great product!
"

Nice, sturdy, lightweight and very flexible. The legs are long enough to give good support for larger heavier smartphones.  Love the tripod. The phone adapator is a bit on the flimsy side. Plastic knurled knob stripped right away.  I upgraded the phone adaptor to one that swiveled and am very happy now
"
5624,"
Very strong and powerful. Able to carry my large camera and helps with travel photos
"
5625,"
This thing is great. Bought it for the bath cause it's waterproof and it wraps around the handle on my soap holder very well. Keeps me from looking down at my mobile but up instead.
"
5626,"
This tripod is perfect. Its strong and easy to use.My wife uses it for blogging and loves it!
"
5627,"
Cumple con lo prometido. La calidad es aceptable para el precio incluso ligeramente superior a lo esperado.Tengo una Cámara Sony alpha y una Canon Rebel y el tripie las soporta perfectamente.Su peso es mínimo y eso es una ventaja para llevarlo de viaje.El adaptador para colocar el celular no es de lo mejor cumple su cometido, sin embargo la parte de plástico que está en contacto con la pantalla no tiene protección (material suave) por lo tanto hay que tener cuidado.
"
5628,"
the more you use it the more it looses stability. Nice for a GoPro/osmo action but not that good with a camera.
"
5629,"
Works as advertised.  Only small problem is that if you have a case that is on the ticket side (as in Otter Box) it might now be held as solidly in the phone holder as you would want.  Workaround is to take it out of the case or simply live with it. ;)
"
5630,"
Totally solid, flexible and strong. I use it for an Anker mini projector which is pretty heavy and have no issues
"
5631,"
This tripod is great quality. It has only a few parts which is great the cell phone holder can be adjusted for portrait or landscape super easily. It’s easy to maneuver the legs where you want to attach them. They bend easily without too much effort. This is the tripod you take every where.

Ha sido muy útil, tenemos más de un año usándolo. Para los tiempos de pandemia y cuarentena ha sido muy útil para hacer videollamdas desde el celular. Para fotos en el exterior es muy práctico por su versatilidad y ligereza (lo llevamos a todos lados).Lo hemos probado con el celular (aunque no nos encanta la manera en que se sujeta porque hace presión sobre la pantalla del teléfono, le damos un 4/5).Para la Go Pro es perfecta! No o hemos probado con cámara pesada de lentes aún.
"
5633,"
Bought this because I needed a selfie stick but went with this for the flexibility so that I can not only hold up camera but place it on awkward surfaces for shooting. It holds my Canon Rebel t3i fairly well. The tripod is PERFECT for cell phones as its light and durable
"
5634,"
La calidad del trípode es bastante buena, me gustó la textura de los materiales y la resistencia que tiene al soportar mi sony a6300.Lo super recomiendo
"
5635,"
Es muy flexible, se adapta a cualquier superficie, además de ser ligero.Cuando grabo caminando se nota el movimiento, con este tripie los brincos desaparecen.Me gustó demasiado
"
5636,"
I purchased this as a tripod for taking timed photos on my Sony Nex-6 and streaming video to twitch.It also has a handy bracket for holding a smartphone. The legs are sturdy and hold their position really well.Very happy with this product.
"
5637,"
Buen producto, fácil de instalar aunque un poco débil en el soporte de celular podría ser un poco más fuerte aunque sirve prefecto.Esta más bajo de lo que pensé
"
5638,"
I had this on my recent trip and it was great to have something that could easily attach to any post, rocky uneven surface, even hold outside the car while driving.
"
5639,"
Excelente lo tengo por 5 meses ya y muy buenoNo se ve frágil ni parece que se romperá fácilSe enrolla fácilmente en cualquier superficie, árbol, poste etc
"
5640,"
It works pretty good but not as steady as something with solid legs so attention needs yo be paid when using it.
"
5641,"
En la descripción del producto incluye un adaptador para go pro y además un adaptador para tomas verticales, sin embargo no venían en la caja, no se como pueda proceder una aclaración.
"
5642,"
Used this product as advertised and it has held up to the test with my Samsung S9 so far in multiple circumstances and positions.  Have not tried this with my camera as it will primarily be for the smart phone.
"
5643,"
Was exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made ,and does what I was hoping it would. Basically just hold the camera securely, and place it almost anywhere you want for the angle you want. It’s perfect for me.
"
5644,"
Excelente calidad. Muy resistente, le agregaría el adaptador para gopro. Lo compré en oferta muy buen precio por la calidad.
"
5645,"
Es muy buena idea para cuando sales de acampada o excursiones, el no le pongo más puntos por la calidad del cabezal que es algo fragíl
"
5646,"
Nice and sturdy with tight legs that stay where you put them.Good purchase.
"
5647,"
A little flimsy in places, but overall, excellent. The bendy legs are superb.
"
5648,"
It’s a nice tripod, the legs are really soft and flexible. However the only down side is my phone can only be held horizontally, there’s no way for it to be standing vertically on the tripod unless you wrap it around a pole.
"
5649,"
You can stand it up, wrap it around things, hold the camera for walking around taking videos it’s great. It works with my Nikon and my iPhone
"
5650,"
El producto cumple lo que promete, se puede ubicar en cualquier sitio siempre y cuando se ajuste correctamente. Una vez que lo deformas se complica hacer totalmente rectas las patas pero pueden moldearse de ma forma que quieras.
"
5651,"
Worked great with my Nikon 5200. Stable while placed on the stairs to take a time delay photo. Downside cannot pivot the head while attempted to use a selfie stick with phone.
"
5652,"
I received this a few days ago and I know I will get good use out of it.  It seems to be well made and is sturdy.
"

Me gustó, muy útil para varias posiciones y aguanta perfecto una réflex
"
5654,"
Great product. Can hang it on virtually anything or use it as a tripod
"
5655,"
I loved it...until the part that holds your phone cracked...and broke. Tried fixing with gorilla glue but broke again! Will not buy again
"
5656,"
It fits well with my Canon T6 and steady. The phone attachment has a soft lining which protects the screen. AND most importantly great price!
"
5657,"
I bought this tripod for my phone and the attachment holds my phone perfectly and it's super secure, the tripod itself is strong and flexible and can hold up my phone up on any surface.

Very sturdy, but wouldn't recommend for huge cameras (check the specs before). Most DSLRs fit, and the antislip rubber casing works well!

I received this tripod today only, and i am quite satisfied with it, plastic quality is nice, phone mount is nice, legs are sturdy and flexible, perfect for beginners, after going through so many products, like adofy and other, i went for this . And i am glad i did.  Big cameras could be a concern but entry level or mirror less cameras are good.
"
5735,"
When I read the comments I was expecting the to be much more sturdy than it was. It has dropped my camera twice and once even to the point it needed repair. I wish the legs were a bit longer and stronger. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
"
5736,"
Value for money product. It has a good grip and product feels and looks like it’s a quality product.
"
5737,"
It costs 1100 but it's worth that. In hand it looks very cool and has got a great quality. The legs finds to move with ease and looks strong. I would totally recommend this.Having a smart phone mount is a great help and it's a quality one. It seems to support DSLR as well, as I own a canon 1300d  and it goes well with the kit lens and camera mounted on the pod.
"
5738,"
Honestly telling guys!! Best for the phone vloggers and worst for the camera vloggers it just can't handle load of camera!! I use it with me phone so it's best for me but when I tried on camera it was just sliding and shifting here and there!
"
5739,"
This is best quality GorrillaPod one can have at this price and within a wide range of options !Just go for it . It withstand my Sony a7m3.So good enough ! ✌️

If you are spending this much of rupees then Its better to increase your budget little bit more and get much better gorillapod

Okay for point and shoot cameras. Does not hold good for dslr. Tried with canon 550d and 55-250 lens. Even with this light setup it could not remain steady. Better is the Joby Gorilla pod.

Product is good but received a broken one disappointed.
"
5757,"
I haven't used it for even 15 days and a leg of it got broken. Amazon raised up there hands for any kind of help. Although it's really easy to use but if this pod is not durable for even 15 days, what more to expect from this product and amazon.
"
5758,"
I loved the product initially but it broke within 3 months.  One of its leg came off and there is no warranty to this product as well.
"
5759,"
First order came broken, replaced item is broken in first use.
"
5760,"
Good product only thing is you can’t have your phone in portrait mode unless you twist the legs all up and have it awkwardly sitting.
"
5761,"
Esta lejos de sustituir a un trípode, pero para viajar es una opción excelente, ocupa poco espacio, lo puedes acomodar de mil formas. La parte negativa es que al ser pequeña en varias situaciones queda a deber como trípode. Pero hace la chamba
"

De verdad me ha sacado de apuros en los que toca llegar a grabar en espacios improvisados como calles o en espacios interiores sobre mesas para grabar charlas, muy recomendable

Just avoid to buy  this item, Save your money and get a good brand better than buying this cheap one . It doesn't worth a dollar , unstable footage , i was carrying this tripod since  the first day and  i was uncomfortable  , sometimes it slips , honestly i started  to use it as stand light of my RGB when i put it onto the desk .

It's hard to get the legs into a position that will reliably support the camera. They will continue to flex if your camera + lens has any weight.

after a month, its garbage. trust me. its so good in 1month of using it. then after that month, 1 leg breaks. not durable. its a waste of money.
"
5786,"
This really is a good simple charger. And like most others this actually comes with the cord and the box to plug it in to charge. I have a 13 pro max. Now it won’t fit in with a case on it standing straight. But if you turn it sideways it will still charge. Without the case in it fits just fine. And it’s metal or some sort of metal. Definitely durable.
"

Easy to use, a great product for sure.

Move 2, 2022 update: wireless charger completely stopped working 8 days after initial use. Exchanging. Hopefully the next one will last a bit longer...Although I asked questions, I got no response from the seller, so I thought I'd purchase one of these and check it out.One question I asked was whether this charger supports Qi EPP (Extended Power Profile), which is the standard promulgated by the Wireless Power Consortium for fast (15W) wireless charging. This standard is primarily used by Google Pixel and Sony Xperia and LG phones. There is nothing on the equipment (stand or included adapter), box, or documentation that suggests it supports Qi EPP.I asked which Pixel phones this charger supports because the product description says it supports ""15W for some Pixel and LG phones."" There is nothing on the box to suggest that it supports Pixel or LG phones at all. However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.
"
5789,"
After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.
"
5790,"
I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.
"
5791,"
The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.
"
5792,"
Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.
"
5793,"
I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.
"
5794,"
This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.
"
5795,"
This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

However, the documentation (picture included) says that it supports ""Google Pixel 6a, 6, 6 Pro, 5a, 5, 4a, 4a(5g), 4, 4XL, 3a, 3aXL, 3, 3XL and other cellphones that support 15W charging.""I have a new Pixel 7 in a Caseology Athlex case, and I purchased both this product (for my desk) and the Anker Nano 3 30W GaN charger (for travel). Following are my charging results thus far:Using this charger with the included fast charging adapter, my Pixel 7 reports ""Charging wirelessly"" predicting full charge in 1:33 from 25% charge. Ampere (see attached photo) reports a charge rate of about 2200mA. The charge rate and predicted full charge remain roughly the same in landscape orientation. Swapping out the included fast charging adapter for my Anker Nano 3 did not appear to change the charge rate.For comparison, wired charging with the Anker Nano 3 seemed to be slightly faster. Although Ampere (see attached photo) reported a charge rate of 4070mA, nearly double the wireless rate of this charger, the Pixel 7 predicted a full charge in 1:18 from 25% while ""Charging rapidly,"" a predicted improvement of only 16%.The unit itself appears well designed. It is lightweight, but sturdy and has no problem holding my Pixel 7. In fact, the back is short enough that the Pixel 7's camera bump does not interfere with flat contact between the phone and the charger, an improvement over other wireless stand chargers I've used. One of the vaunted benefits of this charger is the full aluminum body which purportedly aids in heat dissipation. I have noticed that while using this charger the aluminum becomes warm to the touch, so it seems to be functioning as intended.

After getting our new cell phones a few months ago, I decided to try out the wireless charging function.  I bought two expensive sleek stylish wireless chargers that were well-reviewed.  The one I bought for my wife works well enough, mine is flakey.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I usually end up rebooting the blame thing before it kicks in.So, I thought I would try this one out and am happy to report I am happy!Its not fancy like my previous charger -- there's no indicator lights to show what level of charge  your phone is at -- but bells and whistles are useless when the gizmo won't work!  Besides, the phone lets me know where its at as far as charging, so I'm not missing that feature.As for style, this charger is function first and foremost and it does come in several different colors, so there's that.  I like that I can set my phone upright or just lay it horizontal.  The best part?  This thing is quick as a blister!  So far its been dependable and fast.  I'll update this review if any of that changes.You could spend a lot more for a charger but you won't be getting any more pure functionality than this little beauty right here.

I love the color and the the display look of the charger as opposed to laying it down on the table. I have a note 20 ultra and it makes me nervous that a small bump will make it fall off the stand. I wish the bottom egde was just a bit wider for a more secure hold as my phone hangs off of it. I do love the ease of just being able to set it down and it starts charging.

The magnetic hold works well to keep my Samsung Galaxy S20+ in place, but it does feel like my phone is about to fall off when I'm tapping my alarm off. If the charger was a bit longer to hold the length of my phone, I would be giving this 5 stars. What I find fantastic is that the USB wall charger is included and is the correct amperage for fast charging. This is a key item that it missing from most unknown brands, so kudos to them for including it. For under $20, this is a great deal.

Deducted 1 star because I originally bought this for my S22 Ultra but I can't set my phone in the cradle with the cover on. Without the cover it works great. Other than that it works great. Not really ment for larger phones with cases.

I use a wireless charger that has two extra places for charging my Apple AirPods and my Apple Watch, but looking for a charger to accommodate a phone charge without the extras (for my son who doesn't have the other two items) was a bit challenging.I was excited to find this charger, and it's actually better than expected. It's sturdy and the simple design look sleek and cool, but it also performs well. I like that you can put it on the stand horizontally or vertically and it charges either way. The horizontal presentation allows for viewing movies.This comes with everything needed, including the, often left out, adapter that plugs into the wall.Definitely a great find!PS It charges well with my case on.

This charger does it's job and is able to hold a large phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note S20 Plus with a  protective case. When using the supplied wall adapter it is able to quick charge even with a phone case on, I am able to fully charge my phone from 30% to 100% in about 1.5 hours which is on par with the Samsung quick wireless chargers. I love the slim metal look and the quality feels solid. It doesn't have a cooling fan like the Samsung wireless chargers do but the metal frame acts like a giant heat sink and it stays fairly cool to the touch. You are able to charge your phone either vertical or horizontal which is nice if you want to watch videos on it while it charges. I am very happy with this wireless charger.

This wireless charging stand is deceptive — it looks to be bare-bones, but is really a well designed and very compact package!  My iPhone 13 Pro MAX (plus Pelican MagSafe case) fits securely in either portrait or landscape orientation, and is easily positioned to ""pair"" with the charging coil.  The ""positioning prongs"" are rubberized, so no worries about scratching the phone or case.  Following the minimalist design, there are no charge indicator lights (other than the phone display) if you want to use this on a nightstand.  This charger is very light and has a small footprint and no moving parts, so it's easy to find a space for it or to tuck into a bag when traveling.  Completing the package, an AC adapter and USB-C cable are included.  This is a simple yet elegant device - and it does its job very well!

I received my Intoval Wireless Charing Stand Y3 last Friday from Amazon and I have to say this thing is amazing. It is very well constructed out of aluminum giving it a very premium feal to it. You can charge your phone either standing up or sideways. It also comes with a wall charger and a USB A (which plugs into the charger) to USB C (which plug into the stand. I have the Gun Grey one which matches really well with my MacBook Pro. This is a fast charging stand with an output rating of 5W/7.5W/10W/15W. I did not run into any issues charging my iPhone 13 Pro Max.The only thing of note is that the cord that comes with the unit is a little on the smaller side. If you need a longer cord, then you may want to order a longer USB A cable with this, as the one that comes with it, is only about 3 feet long. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry.

This wireless charging stand was exactly what I was looking for my desk at the office. It isn't the most stylish thing to look at, but it does it's job. It came with a wall charger piece to go with the charging cord, which was very convenient. I like that it charges the phone in either a vertical or horizontal position. It's wide enough so I can charge my Galaxy S22 phone with it's slim case on. I wish it came in a true black color as I'd like to purchase another.

This is a quality made aluminum phone charging stand. I got the silver one and it's the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro with an Otterbox cover. It's narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space and it charged my phone from 64% to 100% in an hour and :45 minutes. A nice feature is that it came ready to use - it included the charger cord and electric outlet plug, so no rooting around for an adapter to make it work. The phone actually sits a little higher on this charger, but I've found the weight of the phone seems to keep it stabilized. All said, a nice product.

First off, it charges about as fast as your basic charger. My husband has been using this at work for both his personal cell and his work cell. His personal phone has a protective Rhinoshield case while his work phone (pictured) has an Otterbox. It will charge his work phone through the case, but it doesn’t fit vertically unless you balance it like we have pictured. We ordered it specifically for his personal phone, and it fits inside perfectly fine. It charges in both orientations and through both cases.

Item arrived looking just like the picture.  I ordered it to put on my kitchen counter to meet a couple of needs.  I wanted something to hold the phone upright when cooking/following a recipe and I also wanted to be able to charge it because I always seem to find that I have low power when I need it for a while.  I unboxed it, plugged it in, and was good to go.  I holds and charges my iphone 12 pro without issue in both a vertical and horizontal position which was a bonus.  So far it has completely met my needs.

I really like this charger for many reasons.-It is a single formed piece of metal. There are no hinges to collapse or fail unexpectedly. No plastic to crack. Because of this design, it's not meant to be portable though.-The metal is very rigid but also very thin which gives it a sleek unobtrusive look.-I have the green color which has a nice shiny metallic finish.-The charging port is your generic USB-C which goes straight out the back allowing you to hide the cable.-The main negative is that the width is limited if you want to set your phone vertically. 85mm is what I measured as the maximum width. My Galaxy S20 with thin case fits with room to spare. You can also place the phone horizontally but it looks a bit awkward.

This was super easy to install. It holds my phone either way, and even with the OtterBox case will charge it but if you do have a thicker case like an OtterBox, it won’t sit in there vertically you have to set it in there horizontally.  It does come with the AC block to plug-in which was great.

I have used this for two nights and it seems to charge well. It is sturdy. The cell phone does not fall off the stand and it has given me extra room on my bedside table. The color pink is gorgeous.

Works great! My phone is able to charge on this without taking protective case off. Like that you can set it upwards or sideways. Perfect size for my nightstand. Charges fast

 This charging phone holder is made up of a metal that is of great quality. I am surprisingly happy with this. I’ll never buy any others if Something Happens with this I’ll buy another one. That’s how good of a quality that says and I’m not just saying that because I’m a vine reviewer, but because I’ve been using this for a week now and it has been awesome you can put your phone in it upright or you can put your phone sideways on it holds it both ways. It was is a great value durable and sturdy also.

I love this iPhone and Apple watch charger! Just drop your watch on the watch charger and it just connects! Same goes for the phone charger. No more missed connections for charging and the stand takes up less room on your table than all those cords! A great charging station.

So cute, great pink color, seems like it should be a great product, but this thing is so flippin' slow to charge, it's really inexcusable. My daughter put her phone (iphone 12 pro max which is listed as a ""compatible device"") on it at 11%. 8.5 hours later, it was at 83%. This is her consistent experience with this ""charger."" Just absolutely unacceptable that any charger can't charge your phone to 100% overnight. Frankly, I don't understand the positive reviews. In our experience, this thing is essentially just a phone stand. We can't recommend.

The only thing I can find to complain about is the lack of a lip or edge, to keep the phone from sliding off the front. If I wasn't trying to tap buttons on it while it sits, or if I didn't have a bracket on the back, i don't think I'd have notices. The rubbery pads work well enough for that.Charges quickly.I love the two orientations.
