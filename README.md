 # Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) - Amazon Reviews
We come across products on the digital medium everyday. Customer reviews where customers, who have already got the product leave a brief description about their experience with the product, is very crucial for future customers whether to buy the product or not. This is a problem for any E-Commerce business to be able to understand customer’s feedbacks. When it comes to sentence reviews, we need to read through every line to make sure we understand customer’s feedbacks. But, fortunately, things like that have got easy with NLP  technology (Natural Language Processing), in the era of Artificial Intelligence. 

Amazon is the largest E-commerce platform in the world. And, customer reviews are proven sales drivers, and something the majority of customers will definitely want to see before deciding to make a purchase.  In this project, an NLP technique has been used to process a set of Amazon reviews, given by customers.  Customer reviews were scrapped using BeautifulSoup. An NLP technique was used to process the reviews. The text have been preprocessed by removing numbers, punctuation, emojis, urls, and stopwords. The resulting text have been represented with Tf-Idf vectorization. The vector representation of the text have been used to perform text clustering. Clusters built with Kmeans algorithm, optimal number of clusters was found using the Elbow method, extraction of clusters topics through clusters centroids coordinates and visualization. It was possible to identify 5 different clusters that describes the segmentation of the customer reviews.
